  <h2 class='c005'>SOME POPULAR MYTHS OF AMERICAN HISTORY</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>Voltaire, the cynic, maintained that “history did not <i>always</i> lie,”
which statement, though somewhat exaggerated, contains the proverbial
exception which often proves the rule. The collector who
adds to his store such autographs as are held for their historical value, soon
realizes that writers of history often fail in their work, through ignorance
of their subject, or from prejudice against giving the truth and nothing
but the truth. History repeats itself, and at all times truth has been so
warped, to serve one purpose or another, that the historical student, especially,
rarely fails to become the confirmed skeptic in his branch of
knowledge. But the subject of historical accuracy, even in relation to
American history, is too extensive a one to be treated of by a single individual
or encompassed within the space which could be allotted to an article
of this character. The author, therefore, proposes to confine himself to the
presentation of some of the historical material which is or has been in his
own collection.</p>

<p class='c011'>The people of New England have, from their earliest settlement, been
as noted for the care with which they have preserved their records as the
people of the other Colonies for their indifference in this regard. It should
not be a matter of surprise, therefore, that in consequence of the great
wealth of this material in New England, the greater portion of our writers
on American history and the compilers of our school books have been, until
within a comparatively recent period, of New England birth or residence.
The presence herein of a great temptation and of a great danger to historical
accuracy are immediately seen, and the author believes that a just criticism
of the works on Colonial and Revolutionary history, especially those
written prior to five-and-twenty years ago, would involve the accusation of
a general lack of fairness toward the other Colonies. This unfairness consisted
in giving undue prominence to the acts of the New England people,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>both individually and collectively, at the expense of the full credit due to
others, and this has been done, not infrequently, when this recognition might
have been given without in any degree lessening that justly due to their own
people. But apart from this want of fairness, or at least indifference, in
the treatment of the deeds of others, foreign to their own territory, the
manuscript material itself was sometimes falsified, as for example, it is
believed Sparks did in the matter of Washington’s letters. General Washington
was a man of very strong passions and was undoubtedly prejudiced
against many of the peculiarities of the New Englanders of his day. And
although few men held themselves in better restraint than he, he would
nevertheless, at times, express himself very freely in regard to the men and
measures of New England.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is said that Sparks manipulated Washington’s correspondence by
striking out every reflection made against the New England people and by
suppressing many letters. Both of these charges the author believes to be
true from his own observation. It has also been charged that in other
instances, Sparks made such interpolations of his own as entirely to change
the original meaning, but of this the writer has no personal knowledge.</p>

<p class='c011'>That the full significance and effect of the spirit of unfairness pervading
these writers of history, may be fully appreciated by the reader, it must
be borne in mind that they had access at one time to an immense mass of
material which was not available outside of New England. Moreover, the
New England authorities were in such frequent communication with all
other portions of the country, that the mass of correspondence, thus gained
and preserved, offered the means of doing fullest justice to the other
Colonies, which were afterwards found to be themselves often without proof
necessary to establish their just claims.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following examples are now offered as evidences of one-sided history
making:</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE PUBLIC SCHOOL</h3>

<p class='c013'>One of the first claims made to the credit of New England was the early
attention paid to public education. It is strictly true that, next to building
a meeting house in a new settlement, a school was put up. But thorough
investigation of this subject furnishes evidence that the chief purpose, at
least, of these schools was to fit young men for the ministry and that they
were not based, either in scope or object, upon the plan of the public school
of the present day. The evidence of this lies in the fact that Latin, Greek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>and Hebrew were chiefly taught, as though to aid the study of the Scriptures
in the original texts, and although boys and girls were doubtless also taught
at these schools, to a limited number, previous to the Revolution, the
salary of the schoolmaster was as a rule, if indeed the rule were not without
exception, paid by division among the pupils themselves and not by the
town. The famous Latin School of Boston, which is often held up to our
admiration as the beginning of the public school system, was chiefly noted
for its Latin course, and each scholar paid about five dollars a term.</p>

<p class='c011'>Granting, however, full measure of praise to New England and with
no desire to minimize the credit due her for her work in this cause, it is still
in order for us to ask when has credit ever been given by any writer to
South Carolina for the establishment in Charleston, about twenty years
before the founding of the Latin School in Boston, of the first school
approaching in character the public schools of to-day? The accompanying
illustration is taken from a volume of the <cite>Charleston Gazette</cite> for the year
1743, once owned by the author but now in the possession of the Lenox
Library of this city, showing the fac-simile of an account for building a
negro free school house. Some years ago the author had in his possession a
memorandum which stated that this school house, built in 1742–3, was the
second which had been erected by the city of Charleston for the education of
negro children, whose parents indeed represented the only portion of the
community unable to educate itself. In these schools the pupils received
gratuitous instruction and were obliged to attend regularly until the age of
twelve years. If the difference in money value, then and now, be considered,
it will be found that the cost of this building could not have fallen
much below five thousand dollars.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is evident, therefore, that the first public school, in the accepted sense,
existed in Charleston, at least as early as 1743, and not in New England.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE BOSTON MASSACRE</h3>

<p class='c013'>The impartial student is fully impressed with the fact that, as his
investigations approach the period just preceding the American Revolution,
the claims of the New England people become more prominent. Here
again, if the writers of our histories and especially of our school books
have not given undue credit to those who were the chief actors in New
England at this period, they have at least uniformly failed to do full justice
to those who were quite as active in the cause in other colonies.</p>

<p>Account of Negro School-House Cost</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Resistance to the Stamp Act had been quite general throughout the country
and the Sons of Liberty in New York were particularly vigilant in
seeing that the Non-importation Act was fully observed, although many
of the merchants did not sympathize with the move. British soldiers were
stationed in all the larger towns and they, taking their cue from those in
authority, showed their enmity towards the people on all occasions. Particularly
marked was this condition of affairs in the city of New York.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the night of January 16th, 1770, the soldiers succeeded in destroying
the Liberty pole in this city after having failed in several previous attempts,
in which they had been driven off by the people. On the following day a
public meeting was called, which at least three thousand sympathizing citizens
attended. Resolutions were passed condemning the hiring of soldiers
for divers purposes by the people, since this custom worked to the disadvantage
of the laboring classes who were thus deprived of steady employment.
A protest was also entered against allowing armed soldiers to wander freely
about the city when off duty. The soldiers promptly resented this action
of the people and a number of brawls took place in various parts of the
town. At length the people concentrated their strength and, after disarming
a number of the soldiers, drove them into barracks. The encounter
in which the largest number on both sides was engaged, took place on
what was called Golden Hill, a place situated on John Street between
William and Cliff Streets. Miss Mary L. Booth, who wrote a most painstaking
and reliable history of the city of New York, previous to the beginning
of the Civil War, refers to this matter as follows: “Thus ended the
battle of Golden Hill, a conflict of two days duration, which, originating
as it did in the defense of a principle, was an affair of which New Yorkers
have just reason to be proud, and which is worthy of far more prominence
than has usually been given it by standard historians. It was not until
nearly two months after that the “Boston Massacre” occurred, a contest
which has been glorified and perpetuated in history; yet this was second
both in date and in significance to the New York Battle of Golden Hill.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It would be difficult to find a better illustration than this of the subject
under consideration. The “Boston Massacre” was at best nothing more
than a street brawl, in which five unarmed spectators were shot down
without the slightest resistance having been made on their part; an affair
with which at the time the people at large of Boston had nothing whatever
to do. It was simply a brutal and dastardly act on the part of the
soldiers, in retaliation for the annoyance offered by one or two irresponsible
boys who had been throwing snow balls. Yet this affair has been magnified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>to such a degree of importance that if the Battle of Bunker Hill had not been
fought in the same neighborhood, this occurrence would doubtless have
been placed in history as the most important event in the Revolution. On
the other hand, the conflict in New York, which lasted for over two days,
was the first stand, and a successful one, made by the people against the
British soldiers. It was an event of very great importance indeed, for not
only was blood first shed but in it was life first lost for the Cause. Yet
how little importance has any New England writer in the past ever attached
to it! It has certainly never been pointed out that the “Battle of Golden
Hill,” in contra-distinction to the “Boston Massacre,” was the beginning
of the struggle.</p>

<p class='c011'>In <cite>Parker’s New York Gazette or Weekly Post-Boy</cite> for Monday, February
5th, 1770, a full and detailed account of the Battle of Golden Hill can
be found. The file of this paper is now in the Lenox Library and this
special issue has been reproduced in fac-simile for the author; but it is so
voluminous that it can not be given here as an illustration.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>If the quartering of troops in one section of the Colonies, rather than
in another, may be accepted as evidence of disaffection among the people
and of organized resistance to the acts of the British Government, then again
full justice has not been done to New York. According to Bancroft British
troops had already been quartered in this city as early as December, 1766,
and were not sent to Boston until at least two years later.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>COMMITTEES OF CORRESPONDENCE</h3>

<p class='c013'>It would not be difficult to prove that the initiative step in the final
struggle was first taken by the Carolinas and by Virginia and that the
people of Boston and of other cities in New England moved rather in
response to pressure from without than at their own suggestion. The men
who became the leaders in the general movement afterwards were beyond
question both sincere and patriotic from the beginning, but the people of
New England were not, at that time, so near a unit in sentiment as were
those of Virginia and of North and South Carolina.</p>

<p class='c011'>The history of those times has yet to be written in which due credit must
be given to Virginia. Instead of that Colony appearing simply as a supporter
and abettor of the acts of Massachusetts, the position hitherto allotted
her, she should be accredited, as she deserves, with the leadership. No
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>one more fully appreciated this fact than Bancroft who, notwithstanding his
changes of opinion on many other points with each edition of his book,
both mentions and accredits nearly every circumstance. But this is done
often with faint praise and with the context not always fairly placed, while
the deeds of the Bostonian are invariably made most prominent. It is
therefore impossible, for the most part, for any one but an expert to arrive
at any other impression than that suggested by the bias of the author.</p>

<p class='c011'>A committee was proposed and organized in Boston, November 3rd,
1772, by Samuel Adams, for the purpose of communicating with the people
in the neighboring towns. In March, 1773, Dabney Carr, a young man
of great promise, offered certain resolutions in the Legislature of Virginia
embodying a plan of Intercolonial Committees of Correspondence, by means
of which all portions of the country could be brought into closer relation.
This organization was perfected by Richard Henry Lee, who soon became
its chief organizer owing to the untimely death of Mr. Carr. The existence
of this organization was of incalculable benefit to the cause of the Colonies,
and it alone, moreover, made possible a favorable termination to the Revolution.
Bancroft, in one portion of his history, pays full tribute to Dabney
Carr and writes, regarding the organization, that “In this manner, Virginia
laid the foundation of our Union; Massachusetts organized a province,
Virginia promoted a confederacy.” And yet, from other portions of Bancroft’s
work the only inference suggested is, that to Samuel Adams alone
is due the credit for this work; and indeed this is the general impression
held, to a great extent to-day, by those who are familiar with our history,
as it is written.</p>

<p class='c011'>The “broadside” here reproduced was issued by the Boston
Committee and is signed with the autograph signature of the secretary.
The mere fact of this issue, in Boston, of the Virginia Resolutions,
urging that the other Colonies should communicate directly with the Virginia
Committee, proves that the one in Boston had been simply a local
affair up to that date and that the proposed general organization did not
originate there.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>“THE BOSTON TEA-PARTY”</h3>

<p class='c013'>So soon as the British Government determined upon the shipment of
tea to the American Colonies, it was arranged that these ships should arrive
at each port very nearly on the same date; thus the people in the different
Colonies would be unable to unite together in their resistance. Through
the organization of the Committees of Correspondence, however, the people
had already become fully united in their determination to prevent the landing
of the tea.</p>

<p>Boston Committee of Correspondence Notice</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>On November 5th, 1773, an alarm was raised in the city of New York
to the effect that a tea-ship had entered the harbor. A large assembly of
the people at once occurred, among whom those in charge of the movement
were disguised as Mohawk Indians. This alarm proved a false
one, but at a meeting then organized a series of resolutions were adopted
which were received by the other Colonies as the initiative step in the plan
of resistence already determined upon throughout the country. Our school
books are chiefly responsible for the almost universal impression that the
destruction of tea, which occurred in Boston Harbor, was an episode confined
to that city; while the fact is, that the tea sent to this country was
either destroyed or sent back to England from every sea-port in the
Colonies. The first tea-ship happened to arrive in Boston and the tea
was first destroyed there; for this circumstance full credit should be given
the Bostonians. But the fact that the actors in this affair were disguised
as Mohawk Indians shows that they were but following the lead of New
York, where that particular disguise had been adopted forty-one days
before, for the same purpose.</p>

<p class='c011'>Previous to the arrival of the ships in Boston, concerted action had
been agreed upon, as has been already shown, in regard to the destruction
of the tea from Charleston, South Carolina, to Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
The people of Philadelphia had been far more active and outspoken
at the outset than they of Boston, and it was this decisiveness which
caused the people of Boston to act, after they had freely sought beforehand
the advice and moral support of the other Colonies.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first tea-ship arrived in Boston on November 28th, 1773, and two
others shortly after, but it was not until the evening of December 16th,
that their contents were thrown overboard at the so-called “Boston Teaparty.”
The “broadside” here presented is one of a number in the collection
of the author, which show fully the feeling of the people of Philadelphia.
The other sheets were issued prior to this one but are without date;
hence this is selected to prove that Philadelphia was actively engaged in
the same purpose, previous to the destruction of tea in Boston.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE MINUTE MEN</h3>

<p class='c013'>Doubtless the earliest and most pleasing recollections of our youth,
in connection with American history, are associated with the “Minute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Men,” as they were termed, of New England. These men are pictured to
us as ever ready to turn out in force to repel the advance of British troops,
at any personal sacrifice, and to serve without pay. It is sad indeed to be
instrumental in dispelling so fair a delusion, but there seems to be sufficient
evidence to prove that this whole story is but a romance. The New
England men did turn out when it was necessary and they made a sturdy
fight when called upon to do so, but they did no more than did the people
of all the other Colonies under like circumstances.</p>

<p class='c011'>The proof of this is found in a document giving “the names of
those Men that did March on the 19th of April last in consequence
of the Alarm made on that Day, who belonged to Ipswich (Mass:) and
was commanded by Jonathan Cogswell, Jun<sup>r.</sup>” Then is given the rank of
each person, the number of miles marched, the number of days out, in
service, and the number of miles marched in returning, &#38;c. At the bottom
of this document is Captain Cogswell’s deposition, made December 18, 1775,
before John Baker, Justice of the Peace, of Ipswich, as to the correctness
of the Roll. On the back of this document we find the following: “Ipswich,
May 22nd, 1776.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* We the subscribers have Rec’d of Capt Cogswell,
Jun<sup>r</sup> the full of our Wages that was Due to Us for our Marching on the
Alarm the nineteenth of April 1775, as Satt down in the within Roll.”
Then follow the signatures of fifty-six men who were paid for their
services.</p>

<p class='c011'>With this before us the evidence seems almost conclusive that not
only were the men of Ipswich paid, but that few if any of those who
fought at the battle of Lexington or of Concord did so without the previous
assurance of pay for their services. It is proven that no one went out from
the town of Ipswich, at least, without compensation, and in so circumscribed
a neighborhood it is scarcely possible that the men of other towns would
have been willing to render service gratuitously, knowing, as they must,
that the men of Ipswich were to be paid. There is no doubt of the fact
that at Lexington, and in the neighboring towns, it was known beforehand
that the British troops were to make an incursion for the purpose of destroying
the military stores. The American authorities, under these circumstances,
naturally made every preparation to repel the attack. It was
necessary to engage men for this public service, and it was proper and just
that they should be paid. No fault can be found with the matter of
remuneration, but this contrast of fact and fiction is here offered as another
evidence of the false and heroic coloring given to the services rendered
by the New England people, during the Revolution, and presented to us
as authentic history.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>THE EFFICIENCY OF THE NEW ENGLAND TROOPS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We will present a copy of a letter, in the author’s possession, written
by General Washington to his business agent, Lund Washington, who had
charge of Mount Vernon. This letter was written from Cambridge, Mass.,
shortly after the General had taken command of the army. It is dated
August 20th, 1775. The greater part is devoted to detailed directions in
regard to the management of the estate and has no bearing on our subject.
But the letter is of so much interest that it is reproduced as a whole. It
was Washington’s custom, as a very methodical man, to preserve a copy of
all his letters, especially of those relating to business, and it is very unlikely
that no draft was preserved by him of this particular letter to Lund Washington,
as well as other letters which are known to exist in private hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Sparks had the private papers of Washington in his possession for
years, for the purpose of writing the former’s life and of editing his correspondence.
Both of these things he did and the latter were published in
twelve volumes.</p>

<p class='c011'>This letter, however, does not appear in Sparks’ work, who states in a
foot-note that very few of the letters to Lund Washington existed. If this
statement is true, it is possible that Washington did not preserve a copy of
this particular letter; but the circumstance is a very remarkable one and not
at all in keeping with his custom in regard to all his other business letters.
If Washington did indeed fail to preserve copies of these letters it was also
a very unfortunate circumstance, for he always wrote to Lund Washington,
without reserve, upon the people and events of his day. That his habit in
this regard was well known needs no stronger confirmation than the fact that
the “Spurious Letters of Washington,” as they are called—which were first
published as original drafts of letters said to have been found in part of
Washington’s baggage and claimed to have been captured by the British—were
all addressed to Lund Washington. The letter here presented shows
that Washington did not always write in so guarded a manner as the
Sparks version of his correspondence would lead us to believe. With this
and other evidence we cannot escape the conclusion, either that Mr. Sparks
was, notwithstanding his unique opportunities, very unfairly dealt with by
Fate, in the scope and completeness of the correspondence entrusted to his
care, or that he himself suppressed those letters which were not to his own
individual taste.</p>

<p class='c017'>Your letter by Capt. Prince came to my hands last Night—I was glad
to learn by it that all are well.—the account given of the behaviour of the
Scotchmen at Port Tobacco &#38; Piscataway surpriz’d &#38; vexed me—Why did
they Imbark in the cause?—what do they say for themselves?—what does
others say of them?—are they admitted into Company?—or kicked out
of it?—what does their Countrymen urge in justification of them?—They
are fertile in invention, and will offer excuses where excuses can be made.—I
cannot say but I am curious to learn the reasons why men who had subscribed
&#38; bound themselves to each other &#38; their Country, to stand forth
in defence of it, should lay down their arms the first moment they were
called upon.</p>

<p class='c017'>Although I never hear of the mill under the direction of Simpson without
a degree of warmth &#38; vexation at his extreme stupidity, yet, if you can
spare money from other Purposes, I could wish to have it sent to him, that
it may, if possible, be set a-going before the works get mixed and spoilt &#38;
my whole money perhaps totally lost—If I am really to loose Barron’s debt
to me, it will be a pretty severe stroke upon the back of Adams, &#38; the expence
I am led into by that confounded fellow Simpson, and necessarily so in
putting my Lands under the management of Cleveland.—</p>

<p class='c017'>Spinning should go forward with all possible despatch, as we shall
have nothing else to depend upon if these disputes continue another year—I
can hardly think that Lord Dunmore can act so low, &#38; unmanly a part, as
to think of siezing Mrs. Washington by way of revenge upon me; however,
as I suppose she is, before this time gone over to Mr. Calvert’s, &#38; will soon
after returning go down to New Kent, she will be out of his reach for 2 or 3
Months to come, in which time matters may, &#38; probably will take such a
turn as to render her removal either absolutely necessary, or quite useless—I
am nevertheless exceedingly thankful to the Gentlemen of Alexandria for
their friendly attention to this point &#38; desire you will if there is any sort of
reason to suspect a thing of this kind, provide a kitchen for her in Alexandria,
or some other place of safety for her and my Papers.—</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>The People of this Government have obtained a character which they
by no means deserved—their officers generally speaking are the most indifferent

Captains for cowardice, and for drawing more Pay &#38; Provisions than they
had Men in their companies.—there is two more Colonels now under arrest,
&#38; to be tried for the same offences—in short they are by no means such
Troops, in any respect, as you are lead to believe of them from the acts
which are published, but I need not make myself Enemies among them, by
this declaration, although it is consistent with truth.—I dare say the Men
would fight very well (if properly officered) although they are an exceedingly
dirty &#38; nasty people.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a>—had they been properly conducted at Bunker’s
Hill (on the 17th of June) or those that were there properly supported, the
regulars would have met with a shameful defeat; &#38; a much more considerable
loss than they did, which is now known to be exactly 1057 killed &#38;
wounded—it was for their behaviour on that occasion that the above officers
were broke, for I never spared one that was accused of Cowardice but
bro’t ’em to immediate Tryal.</p>

<p class='c017'>Our Lines of Defence are now compleated as near so at least as can be—we
now wish them to come out, as soon as they please, but they (that
is the enemy) discover no Inclination to quit their own works of Defence;
&#38; as it is almost impossible for us to get to them, we do nothing but watch
each other’s motions all day at the distance of about a mile; every now and
then picking of a stragler when we can catch them without their Intrenchments;
in return, they often attempt to cannonade our Lines to no other
purpose than the waste of a considerable quantity of Powder to themselves
which we should be very glad to get.—</p>

<p class='c017'>What does Dr. Craik say to the behaviour of his countrymen, &#38; Townspeople?—remember
me kindly to him, &#38; tell him that I should be very glad
to see him here if there was anything worth his acceptance; but the Massachusetts
people suffer nothing to go by them that they can lay hands
upon.—</p>

<p class='c017'>I wish the money could be had from Hill, or the Bills of Exchange
(except Col. Fairfax’s, which ought to be sent to him immediately) turn’d
into cash; you might then, I should think, be able to furnish Simpson with
about £300; but you are to recollect that I have got Cleveland &#38; the hired
People with him to pay also.—I would not have you buy a single bushel of
wheat till you can see with some kind of certainty what market the Flour is
to go to—and if you cannot find sufficient Imployment in repairing the Mill
works, and other things of this kind for Mr. Robers and Thomas Alferd,
they must be closely Imployed in making cask or working at the Carpenter’s
or other business—otherwise they must be discharged, for it is not reasonable,
as all Mill business will probably be at an end for a while, that I am
to pay them £100 a year to be Idle.—I should think Roberts himself must
see, and be sensible of the reasonableness of this request, as I believe few
Millers will find Imployment of our Ports are shut up, &#38; the wheat kept in
the straw, or otherwise for greater security.—</p>

<h3 class='c012'>WEEMS’ “LIFE OF WASHINGTON.”</h3>

<p class='c013'>Weems, the book peddler, who was not a New England man, wrote
for his own ends, one of the most popular books in his so-called “Life of
Washington.” It is said to have gone through some forty editions,
Washington declined, and very naturally, to give him access to his papers;
hence Weems was thrown entirely upon the resources of his imagination
for the material which he needed. It was natural, therefore, and not difficult
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>with so free a hand, to make up a good story. Hence the origin of the
incident of the Cherry Tree and little hatchet, and other like truthful and
popular anecdotes, which have become almost <i>historical</i> in our day.</p>

<p class='c011'>Excuse may be found for Weems on the score of his commercial
instinct, the inaccessibility of facts and of his irresponsibility; but what can
be said in mitigation of the offence of those New England historians, who
have distorted facts, although they had access to all the material necessary
to have enabled them to do full justice to others as well as to their own
people? These men assumed, and upon them rested, the solemn responsibility
of teachers and defenders of historical Truth!</p>

<p class='c011'>The author here disclaims all prejudice and has no other motive than
an earnest desire to establish the truth. This issue is made with the writers
of the past and not with the country nor with the people of the present day.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>true</i> history of New England is sufficiently great to enable her to
look fearlessly into the mirror of Truth, and she can well afford to cast off

  <h2 class='c005'>EARLY MENTION OF EVENTS AND PLACES IN THE CHAMPLAIN VALLEY.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c018'>I</h3>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>The origin of place-names, and the reason for them, are always matters
of interest. Sometimes we may know both, often only one, and
sometimes neither. Frequently a dead and forgotten old resident
survives in the name of the hill he built his house on, or of the pond or
brook by the side of which he lived, or in the property he once owned, or
even in some event in which he was a prominent actor. Thus, the Brighams
of Essex, in Brigham Hill; the Burlings, in Burlington; Count Fredenburgh,
in Fredenburgh Falls and M. Chasy, nephew of Tracy, in Chazy,
have a kind of immortality. The name of Samuel Champlain is preserved
not only in the Lake which is called after him, but in the River Champlain,
the Town Champlain, the Village Champlain; and who can give the number
of Champlain hotels and streets, in the cities and towns and villages of
the United States and of the British Provinces north of us? Also it is
interesting that many localities in our very midst have had names in common
use for a time, which, later, are lost in oblivion.</p>

<p class='c011'>For years I have noted place-names and their reputed origin, both
curious and suggestive, in our locality; and am constantly adding to them.
Quite recently a man in our city spoke of Happy Hill, and another, in a
neighboring town, of Pirate’s Hollow. Thus I added two to my list, and
inquiry revealed their origin. I can give, approximately, the beginning of,
and reason for, Providence Island, Gougeville, Molasses Corner, North and
South Hero, Johnnycake Street and North Africa. Even The Devil’s Half
Acre has quite a known history. But I greatly desire information concerning
Whig Hollow, Cumberland Head, Beartown, Valcour, Suckertown,
The Lost Nation, and many others.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the western border of Lake Champlain, scarce five miles from its
outlet into the Richelieu river, in the town of Champlain, opposite the lower
end of Isle La Motte, is a famous headland called Point au Fer, freely
rendered into English Point of Iron—Iron Point. But its common and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>only name now is the French Point au Fer. No iron is found there, and
there is nothing suggestive of the hardness of iron in its shape, or in the
ruggedness of its shores. Hadden, Riedesel, Phillips and many others called
it Point au Fer only, and I think it proper to consider this to be its real
name, in spite of the fact that on a map issued about 1748, from surveys
made in 1732, it is called Point au Feu, or, in English, Point of Fire—Fire
Point. It may be that the transcribers mistook the final r for u, an easy
mistake when we consider the similarity between r and u as often found in
old manuscripts.</p>

<p class='c011'>I think I have chanced on the origin of and reason for this place-name.
I will present my evidence to you and hope you will agree with me, or disagree,
if you have reason to the contrary.</p>

<p class='c011'>This evidence is found in and based upon, an account in volume 48,
pages 99–107, of “The Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents,” edited by
Reuben G. Thwaites, secretary of the Wisconsin Historical Society. This
volume, 48, came out in July, 1899. The original was the Relation of
1662–63, written by Father Jerome Lalemant, and contains a graphic
account of a fierce fight between some Algonquins and a band of Iroquois
returning from a raid on Montreal.</p>

<p class='c011'>Father Lalemant says:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Algonquins living at Sillery, after passing the winter in innocence
and piety, resolved, towards spring, to go and wage a petty warfare.
They were only forty, but their courage exceeded their number. Arriving
at the Richelieu Islands without discovering any foe, they entered the river
of the same name and directed their course to Lake Champlain, where they
lay in ambush. Scarcely had they arrived there when those victors who
had dealt their blow at Montreal, and were conducting their poor Frenchmen
in triumph, were discovered by our Algonquins, who followed them
with their eyes and noted their camping spot. Our Christian soldiers,
under cover of the night, stealthily advanced and surrounded the place where
the enemy were sleeping, in readiness to attack them at the first dawn of
day. But as it is very difficult to walk in the night time without making a
noise, or by hitting some branch, one of the Iroquois chiefs was awakened
in some way or other. He was a brave man named Garistatsia (“the
Iron”), vigilant and greatly renowned for his exploits performed against
us and against our savages. The chief of the Algonquins, perceiving that
the leader of the Iroquois was this Garistatsia—or in French Le Fer, so
famous and renowned by the many disasters that have so often made us
mingle our tears with our blood, made straight at him and by a hatchet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>stroke on the head, forced Garistatsia to fall to the ground, where his courage
forbade him to acknowledge himself vanquished, and he yielded the
victory after losing his life. Ten of the enemy remained dead on the spot,
while three were taken alive, and the rest escaped, completely covered with
wounds.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was a terrific engagement, though short. It evidently occurred
on the west shore of Lake Champlain, between a band of Iroquois raiders
returning over land from Montreal and a band of Algonquins, who, coming
up the Richelieu, had “scarcely arrived” at Lake Champlain. These
latter proceeded to surround the Iroquois. How much more easily
surrounded on a point than on a continuous shore! The leader
of the Iroquois “was famous and renowned.” He had “so often made
us” <i>i. e.</i> both French and Algonquins, “mingle our tears with our blood!”
So well known was he that the leader of the Algonquins, even in the dark,
“made straight at him”—in order to rid the country of this distinguished
enemy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Therefore, I think it not unreasonable to claim that this battle, in the
year 1663, was fought on the cape on the west border of Lake Champlain
opposite the lower portion of Isle La Motte, known now and for so many
years as Point au Fer, and that the cape received its appellation from that of
the mighty Iroquois chief killed there—“Garistatsia, or in French Le Fer.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>II</h3>

<p class='c013'>The matter of prehistoric occupation of the Valley of Lake Champlain
has received considerable attention during the last twenty-five years.
Before that time, historians would refer to Champlain’s vague statements
concerning the enemies of his Algonquin allies residing around the mountains
in the east and south, and then state that but few vestiges remained
of ancient occupation. But later researches have revealed the fact that this
valley was once quite thickly populated. I know of at least forty-five
dwelling sites, the greater portion of which I have located and visited. The
larger part of these are on, or near, the Lake itself; but there are, also, many
on the rivers and smaller streams and lakes; and some at a distance from
any even moderately large body of water. The evidence of former dwelling
sites consists of stone implements and weapons, and chippings scattered
over small areas—say of half an acre or more. One such site exists on the
River Richelieu, in the Parish of St. Valentine, near Isle aux Noix, twelve
miles below Rouses Point. From this place alone I have obtained several
hundred stone implements and weapons, some of them very fine.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Another is at the mouth of the Big Chazy River, near Point au Fer.
It was October 5, 1881, that I first discovered this dwelling site, and in
two hours I picked up about thirty stone axes and many chipped flints; and
had not the night come on, I should have obtained at least twice as many
at that visit. To an ardent collector, so many things almost beseeching
to be gathered furnished an experience not readily forgotten. I presume
that any of you would have done as I did. You would have taken off
your shoes and stockings, and found with your feet, stone axes in the clay
mud of the bottom, and picked them out with your hands; and would have
wished the sun to stand still at least an hour, in order that you might obtain
more.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another place is on a high sand plain in the town of Ausable, New
York. Here the ground is white with quartzite chippings over many acres,
though this locality has furnished but few perfect implements.</p>

<p class='c011'>From Colchester Point upon the Ouinooski river, certainly as far as
Williston, the soil abounds in celts, chippings and wrought flints. But to
locate and describe all the known sites would require far too much time,
and I presume the half of them have not been discovered.</p>

<p class='c011'>However, in many particulars, the most important prehistoric dwelling
place in our Valley is that on the shore of Cumberland Bay, partly within
the present limits of the city of Plattsburgh. Here was a sand ridge a
mile long, from twenty to forty rods wide, fifteen to twenty-five feet high,
having a sluggish stream abounding in fish on its landward side, and the
wide bay opening out into the broad lake, on the other. The greyish white
sand between the pines on the ridge and the waters of the bay, was a conspicuous
object for miles out on the lake. About thirty-five years ago some
of the pines were cut off, and the wind made openings through and through
the ridge at right angles to the axis of its length. Then it was seen that
here was once a great village, covering the whole ridge. Below the old
surfaces were vast quantities of flint chippings, arrow and spear points,
axes, pottery, fire-places, kitchen middens, and other evidences of ancient
occupation. From this site alone, I have secured fragments of hundreds
of edge pieces of different jars of pottery, and thousands of wrought implements
of stone.</p>

<p class='c011'>In our early researches, where the sand had not been blown out down
to the level of the lake, there were seen heaps of cobble stones, arranged in
some order, each perhaps consisting of a bushel or more of sand stones that
had been heated by fire. These heaps rested in sand and ashes blackened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>by charcoal, but never, in a single instance did they contain flints, wrought
stones or pottery. In other words, these were not kitchen middens.</p>

<p class='c011'>For years, I supposed this place to have been prehistoric, as it mostly
was. But in 1885, the Prince Society of Boston, in its invaluable series
of historical publications, printed “Radisson’s Voyages.” Now, Peter
Esprit Radisson was a Frenchman of roving disposition, who came from
France to Canada in 1651. He made several “voyages,” as he calls them,
going through Lake Champlain to the Iroquois country; and again to Lake
Huron and Lake Superior; and, I believe, overland to Hudson’s Bay, in
his various journeyings. But he did what we wish more of those early
adventurers had done. He left a written account of his experiences. This
record was made partly in French and partly in English and is very full of
interest. In the year 1652, he was out hunting on the St. Lawrence River,
one day, was made prisoner and taken up the Richelieu, through Lake
Champlain and thence to the country of the Iroquois. I quote from his
“Relation of My Voyage being in Bondage in the hands of the Irokoits.”
After being captured (and his captivity seems to have been a pleasant one
from beginning to end), he says: “Midday wee came to the River of
Richelieu, where we weare not farr gone, but met a new gang of their
people in cottages” (village No. 1). After a day and a night, he continues:
“Our journey was indifferent good without any delay, w’ch
caused us to arrive in a good and pleasant harbour. It was on the side
of the sand where our people had any paine scarce to errect their cottages,
being that it was a place they had sejourned at before.” (Village No. 2).
The next day, he says: “At 3 of the clock in the afternoon we came to a
rappid streame, where we were forced to land and carry our Equipages and
boats through a dangerous place. Wee had not any encounter that day.
Att night where we found cottages ready made (village No. 3), there I cutt
wood with all dilligence. The morning early following, we marched wth
making great noise, or singing as accustomed. Sejourning awhile, we
came to a lake 6 leagues wide, about it a very pleasant country, imbellished
with great forests.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* We arrived to a fine sandy bancke, where not
long before Cabbanes weare errected and places made where Prisoners
weare tyed.” (Village No. 4.)</p>

<p class='c011'>“In this place our wild people sweated after the maner following: first
heated stones till they were redd as fire, then they made a lantherne with
small sticks, then stoaring the place with deale trees, saving a place in the
middle, whereinto they put the stoanes, and covered the place with small
covers, then striped themselves naked, went into it. They made a noise as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>if ye devil weare there; after they being there for an hour they came out of
the watter. I thought veryly they weare incensed. It is their usual custom.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* In the night they heard some shooting, which made them
embark themselves speedily. In the meanwhile they made me lay downe
whilst they rowed very hard. I slept securely till morning, when I found
meselfe in high rushes. There they stayed without noise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, this  “rappid streame”  was the Chambly Rapids.</p>

<p class='c011'>This 3d village, in my opinion, was that site below Isle Aux Noix, in
the parish of St. Valentine, which I have spoken of. Villages No. 1 and
No. 2 I have never visited. The lake  “imbellished with great forests,”
was Champlain. The  “fine sandy bancke, where not long before cabbanes
weare errected,” was, I feel certain, this great dwelling place on Cumberland
Bay. The heaps of fire stones that I have mentioned could easily have
been those made use of by  “our wild people”  when they  “sweated after
the maner following:” and where Radisson found himself in “high
rushes”  the morning after, may have been at the mouth of the Ausable; or
of the Lamoille, or of the Ouinooski.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>III</h3>

<p class='c013'>For some time I have endeavoured to make an annual visit to Fort
Ticonderoga and its neighborhood. September, October and November,
before the ground freezes, when the lake is usually the lowest, are the
best portions of the year for searching there. On the shores between high
and low water marks around the Ticonderoga promontory; at Wright’s
Point and on the Orwell shore opposite, the earth is black with flints.
These are arrow and spear heads, knives, hammer stones and immense
quantities of flakes. But few of the implements are perfect. I account for
this condition because of the great numbers of soldiers there in the old wars.
As you know, it was their practice to select the best arrow and spear heads
and break them into pieces suitable for their flintlocks. But the native flint
exists in great abundance in the limestone rocks of the locality; and so it
was that, for centuries, the Indians resorted to this region, lived there and
made weapons and implements for their own use, and for traffic with other
savages passing by. I have obtained 2500 chipped stone implements from
these shores alone. One November day, 1896, two of <a id='t82'></a>us left Plattsburgh
by train at 8.30 a. m., reached Fort Ticonderoga at 10.30, picked up 575
wrought flints, and returning, got home at 6.15 the same evening. So,
while I have considered that the great dwelling site in Plattsburgh was the
most important for the manufacturing of pottery, and probably had the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>largest population of any village in the valley, yet certainly the Ticonderoga
region surpassed it in the making of chipped implements. On this day of
which I speak, my companion stopped on Mount Independence, while I
pushed over to the Orwell shore, perhaps a hundred rods away. And, by
the way, let me say that the historic ruins on Mount Independence are
nearly as interesting as those on the Ticonderoga promontory. I could
not see the gentleman on the mountain because of the trees, but when I
called out to him, not only his reply came to me, but my voice echoed back
first, so quickly, so distinctly and with such force as to startle me. It was
uncanny.</p>

<p class='c011'>Turning again to the Jesuit Relations, this time to Volume 51, pages
179–183; in the Relation of 1667–68, written by Francis Mercier, we find
an account of the experiences of Fathers Fremin, Pierron and Bruyas,
three Jesuits, on the way to the Iroquois country. It was one of these
fathers who wrote from Ste. Anne, Isle La Motte, August 12, 1667, the
interesting letter, a translation of which was printed in the Burlington Free
Press of August 22, 1902.</p>

<p class='c011'>Father Mercier says: “The Fathers Fremin, Pierron and Bruyas
having set out to go to the lower Iroquois—and having been detained for a
long time in Fort Sainte Anne at the entrance to Lake Champlain&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*
left the fort at last.” Then he quotes from their journal: “About four
o’clock in the afternoon we embarked to go and take shelter at a league
distance from the last fort of the French—which is that of Sainte Anne&#160;*&#160;* We gaily crossed this entire great lake, which is already too renowned
by reason of the shipwreck of several of our Frenchmen, and, quite recently,
by that of Sieur Corlart, commandant of a hamlet of the Dutch near Agnie,
who, on his way to Quebec for the purpose of negotiating some important
affairs, was drowned while crossing a large bay, where he was surprised
by a storm. Arriving within three-quarters of a league of the Falls by
which Lake St. Sacrament empties, we all halted without knowing why,
until we saw our savages at the water side gathering up flints, which were
almost all cut into shape. We did not at that time reflect upon this, but
have since learned the meaning of the mystery, for our Iroquois told us
that they never fail to halt at this place to pay homage to a race of invisible
men who dwell there at the bottom of the lake. These beings occupy themselves
in preparing flints, nearly all cut, for the passers by, provided the
latter pay their respects to them by giving them tobacco. If they give these
beings much of it, the latter give them a liberal supply of these stones.
These water men travel in canoes, as do the Iroquois; and when their great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>captain proceeds to throw himself into the water to enter his palace, he
makes so loud a noise that he fills with fear the minds of these who have no
knowledge of this great spirit and of these little men.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* The occasion
of this ridiculous story is the fact that the lake in reality is often agitated by
very frightful tempests, which cause fearful waves, and when the wind
comes from the direction of the lake, it drives on the beach quantities of
stones which are hard, and capable of striking fire.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, this place where the fathers “sheltered themselves at a league’s
distance” from Fort Sainte Anne, may have been Cumberland Head. The
bay in which “Sieur Corlart” was drowned has been considered to be
Willsborough Bay. Allow me to state that Arendt Van Corlaer
(“Sieur Corlart”) came to his death in this very year, 1667, in which these
Jesuits saw the savages at the water side gathering up flints. So the
Indians 235 years ago had an established custom of picking up flint implements
around Ticonderoga; the same practice that I have indulged in, perhaps
quite as successfully without having to offer tobacco to a race of
invisible men; and the “loud noises” which their “great captain” made
when he proceeded to throw himself into the water to enter his palace and
“which filled with fear the minds of those who have no knowledge of this
Great Spirit and of these little men,” may have been an echo, like that
marvelous one which came back to me from Mount Independence, on that
November day, so loud and distinct as to seem uncanny.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c011'>I have thus grouped these three different parts although they may not
be homogeneous. In some degree they unite the present with the early
historic and prehistoric past of the Champlain Valley. I understand that
the United States Government is soon to issue a large volume of Place-Names,
and such work is highly to be commended. What an immense
number our own localities could furnish to be thus preserved!</p>

<p class='c011'>In the early Voyages, Journals, Relations and Letters are references
to many known locations. But, for instance, should Radisson, or the
Jesuit Relations or even Hadden, go to new editions during the next half
century, the present notes, though copious, would seem meagre and inadequate,
compared with what should then appear.</p>

<p class='c011'>Concerning matters prehistoric, I hope I have said enough to reveal
what a vast field for research lies almost untouched at our very doors.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CAPTAIN ABRAHAM LINCOLN <i>versus</i> PRIVATE LORENZO DOW THOMPSON</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c018'>THE STORY OF A CELEBRATED CONTEST</h3>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>While searching for material affecting the history of the Black
Hawk War, of course I found the stereotyped version of the noted
wrestling match between Captain Abraham Lincoln and an obscure
private from the St. Clair company of Captain William Moore; the same
published in Nicolay and Hay’s Life of Lincoln. But not until too late for
my purpose did I secure its details with anything like accuracy. A long
course of investigation has just rewarded me with the facts.</p>

<p class='c011'>The match was celebrated, the State over, long before Lincoln became
famous and it must be admitted a pleasure to turn from the serious man,
to the early, robust Lincoln; the young man of stature and strength, informal
as he was when just reaching man’s estate and in possession of his first
prize in life.</p>

<p class='c011'>It may seem ridiculous to class the modest office of captain of a company
of sixty day volunteers, as a proud position, yet Leonard Swett has
told us the day of Lincoln’s election to such a position in 1832, was the
proudest of the latter’s life.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Governor Reynolds called out the militia to remove Black
Hawk and his band from Illinois soil, “dead or alive,” Abraham Lincoln
as he has told us, was “out of a job,” and enlistment therein invited him
to place, adventure and perhaps renown. A company of sixty-eight
intractable spirits (two more were added subsequently), was organized in
Sangamon County and enrolled on April 21st, of which Lincoln was elected
captain and from which he was expected to exact discipline. His First
Sergeant was John Armstrong, the gentleman who had undertaken with
disastrous personal results, to introduce Lincoln to New Salem “life”
through the medium of a wrestling match. William Kirkpatrick, said to
have filched a cant-hook from Lincoln, as well as the latter’s rival in the
contest for captain, was another. The Clary boys, Royal and William, who
acted disagreeable parts at the Armstrong function, were of the number,
while as though smiling at the joke of it, “Pleasant” Armstrong was
another private. Finally from the sentimental side we find the names of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>John M. and David Rutledge to add to the list. Truly a picturesque
crowd!</p>

<p class='c011'>Once organized, the company was marched to Beardstown to be sworn
into the service of the State by Inspector General John J. Hardin, where too
the captain fell in with such men as O. H. Browning, Edward D. Baker,
Adam W. Snyder, John Dement, Gov. Carlin and others who became
famous in the history of the State and Nation. At that point the companies
were formed into regiments and moved toward “The Yellow
Banks” <i>en route</i> for the mouth of Rock River where Captain Lincoln was to
meet General Henry Atkinson, and Lieut.-Col. Zachary Taylor, as well as
Lieutenant Robert Anderson, Lieutenant Jefferson Davis, Captain William
S. Harney, Lieut. Albert Sidney Johnston and many others who were to be
prominent in his future during the great crisis of our country.</p>

<p class='c011'>In referring to the nights of that period, O. H. Browning in his journal
of May 2d, wrote that they were “cold and tempestuous;” so that choice
camping grounds, affording wood and water, were eagerly sought and when
found, the scramble for their possession was spirited.</p>

<p class='c011'>At, or just out of Beardstown, the companies of Captain Lincoln and
Captain William Moore from St. Clair County, came upon just such a
camping ground simultaneously and for its occupation a strife arose of
course. With the propensity for free fights, usual to those days, it may
appear miraculous at this day that such an affray was avoided; but as
Captain Lincoln felt his official oats at the time and may have desired
to reap a little personal advantage from the collision, he proposed to Captain
Moore that “‘captain for captain,’ the matter should be settled by a
match.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But as every rule of wrestling forbade a contest so unequal, Captain
Moore, who declined, suggested as a substitute the selection of a man
from each company. That appeared fair enough and with a metaphorical
chip on his shoulder Captain Lincoln selected himself to represent his company,
while Captain Moore who was not an authority on “wrestling form,”
turned over the function of selection to his brother, Jonathan Moore,
Orderly Sergeant.</p>

<p class='c011'>The latter knew his business even though a shout of derision went up
from Lincoln’s men when the champion was produced. When led up for
slaughter, the victim was found to be just above medium height and weight
and so unobtrusive and guileless that I had almost forgotten to mention
his name:—Lorenzo Dow Thompson of St. Clair County.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Captain Lincoln chortled and gave the upstart a look of such fine scorn
that the poor fellow should have been sorry for living and had the affair
been one of to-day we surely could have heard the captain shout “what a
cinch!” when the books were opened for bets.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jonathan Moore was called to referee the match which was to consist
of “best two in three” falls. He tossed up a coin, winning choice of
“holts” for Thompson, who chose “side holt.” Lincoln’s was “Indian
holt,” and generally speaking it was a scrappy sort of a “holt” too. At
once a great scramble followed among Lincoln’s men to lay their bets before
Captain Moore’s men got “scart.” But Captain Moore’s men refused to
get “scart.” In fact there was a very suspicious degree of firmness and
unanimity in their opinion of “Dow” Thompson’s ability to take care of
himself and any loose change his friends might put up on him; so up went
powder-horns, guns, watches, coats, horses, pay-rolls and reputations until
there remained not one solitary article of property in possession or expectancy
thereof which had not been put into the pot on that match.</p>

<p class='c011'>To increase the zest of his men for gaming, Captain Lincoln who was
cock-sure of victory, had urged them to offer odds and discount the future
all they could, and the men did it. Then the combatants grappled—side
holt,—Thompson’s choice.</p>

<p class='c011'>They see-sawed. The spectators shouted. Momentarily Lincoln’s
men bantered Thompson with words of encouragement, “just to drag the
sport out and get their money’s worth,” but when they discovered their
error there appeared a temporary inspiration by the Clary boys to meddle.
The Armstrong boys wanted to get busy as the contest proceeded, but before
any of these meddlers could devise a plan, the long legs of the captain cleft
the air and in the very next instant Thompson had him fairly upon the
ground. The din which followed would have silenced a thunderstorm.</p>

<p class='c011'>As said of the boy who fell down cellar:—he did not hurt himself,
but <i>did</i> hurt his new pants, so it might be said of the chagrined captain after
that first fall. His person had not been harmed but the disaster to his feelings
was something dreadful. Particularly harmful because the crowd to
witness it had quadrupled several times, each installment adding a few
words of humiliation. Defeat in the presence of a few friends would have
been dreadful, but surrounded by an army and he a captain, it was a catastrophe.
Even the swagger back to the center did not square it. His
friends shouted: “That’s only one fall, while two more are due.” That
encouragement did not place his confidence <i>in statu quo</i>. But he made his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>bluff by stating icily when he had secured his “holt:” “Now Mr. Thompson,
it’s your turn to go down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Indian hug or “holt” did not work at all however. In fact the
patronizing captain was kept busy trying to keep his feet solid against the
multitude of tricks which Thompson had up his sleeve to thwart the captain’s
favorite “holt.” At last it was abandoned as altogether useless.</p>

<p class='c011'>The redoubtable captain followed with a “crotch-holt,” but that
terrible device was resisted as easily as water runs from a duck’s back. A
trick called “sliding away,” was introduced, only to confirm the growing
opinion of the spectators that the doughty wrestler from Sangamon had
met his master.</p>

<p class='c011'>A moment of indecision followed, the slipping of a mental cog, so to
speak,—just enough to allow the despised St. Clair man to get in his fine
work, and once more the legs of the valiant captain rose in the air and both
men fell to the ground in a heap.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dog fall!” yelled Lincoln’s men.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fair fall!” retorted Moore’s men.</p>

<p class='c011'>A free fight was imminent, but Lincoln, disgruntled and defeated
though he was—in one fall at least—was a “good loser.” Springing to
his feet before the referee could act, he cried: “Boys! The man actually
threw me once fairly; broadly so, and this second time—this very fall, he
threw me fairly though not apparently so.” That settled the matter and
the frankness of the speaker saved him his reputation although his men had
lost all their available property.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the 8th day of August, 1860, Professor Risdon Marshall Moore,
then of McKendree College (now of San Antonio, Texas), son of the
referee, Jonathan Moore, called upon Mr. Lincoln at the latter’s house in
Springfield with a delegation of college men, devotedly attached to Mr.
Lincoln’s cause. In introducing Prof. Moore, Lieutenant Governor Koerner
added, “of St. Clair County.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Prof. Moore then stated: “Mr. Lincoln, we have called to see the
next President.” To which Mr. Lincoln replied: “You must go to
Washington to see the next President.”</p>

<p class='c011'>During this and other conversation which followed, Mr. Lincoln eyed
Prof. Moore constantly with a suspicious twinkle of the eye, after which he
asked: “Which of the Moore families do you belong to? I have a
grudge against one of them.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Professor Moore replied with a still merrier twinkle: “I suppose it
is my family you have the grudge against, but we are going to elect you
President and call it even.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There were present at that meeting the same O. H. Browning who had
witnessed the match nearly thirty years before, Norman B. Judd, Richard
J. Oglesby and some others, to all of whom Mr. Lincoln related the story
as herein told, concluding with these words: “I owe that Moore family
a grudge, as I never had been thrown in a wrestling match until the man
from that company did it. He could have thrown a grizzly bear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor Thompson! He migrated to Harrison County, Missouri, and
became its first representative in the General Assembly of the State in 1846 <a id='t90'></a>and
was re-elected in 1848. He was also a member of the first grand jury of
the county. Politically he was called an anti-Benton Democrat. Positive
in all his convictions, he was called eccentric toward the end of his life, but
all who knew him testify that he was able, upright and a good neighbor and
citizen.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1875 he died in indigence at the age of 65 and his body lies in Oakland
cemetery six miles north of Bethany.</p>

<p class='c011'>Singularly enough, we are told that to the same point migrated one
Peter Rutledge who claimed to be brother to Ann Rutledge.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the early history of Illinois, the Moores were known as the “fighting
Moores,” by reason of their daring in the Indian war of 1812–14 and
the border troubles which were constantly menacing our frontier.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jonathan Moore who was born in Georgia, Nov. 20, 1799, was one of
the number. He moved to Illinois in 1812, served in the Black Hawk War
and enlisted in the Mexican War, but his company was rejected because
troops enough had already been sent to the front.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the breaking out of the Civil War, he enlisted and was made captain
of company “G” Thirty-second Illinois Infantry and served at Shiloh
and other hard fought engagements.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>SIDE-LIGHTS ON CAROLINA HISTORY</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>My object in the following paper is not to present a summary of
South Carolina history, enumerating well-known dates and facts
already recorded by much better writers, but rather to furnish
sundry varied items of information which, while not themselves entitled to
rank as history, may yet serve a useful purpose as side-lights upon history
proper.</p>

<p class='c011'>South Carolina has always occupied an almost unique position in the
family of States. Geographically small, numerically weak, she has nevertheless
managed to make her influence felt throughout the Federation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus much concerning her is known to the world at large, but the very
peculiar conditions which existed for many years within her borders are not
so generally known to outsiders. Yet it is these conditions which to a great
extent moulded State character and influenced State politics. Indeed they
are the key without which it would be impossible to explain many anomalies,
in both her political and social history.</p>

<p class='c011'>Presenting an unbroken front to the world, a solid unit on all questions
of national policy, within herself she was divided into two jarring and
irreconcilable factions. How this sectional antagonism originated, or when
it first showed itself it is impossible to say. But the unnatural animosity
once developed, the exceptional conditions existing in the State were unfortunately
calculated to aggravate and perpetuate it. The root of the evil
was that old grudge of the mass against class. Broadly speaking, the
wealth and cultivation of South Carolina were confined to a single section
of the State instead of being scattered throughout the whole. Orders and
degrees of men have existed in all times and in all lands, but in South
Carolina they were, so to speak, geographically distributed—the “orders”
being found in the interior, and the “degrees” along the sea-board.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus, socially considered, a very broad line of demarcation separated
the State into two distinct sections; and in many respects in manners, in
habits, even in speech, the people of the two differed widely one from
the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>Along the coast lay the great rice-plantations, containing thousands of
acres and worked by hundreds of slaves; their proprietors constituting
the landed aristocracy of the State. In the interior, the plantations were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>smaller, there were fewer slaves, and their owners were “farmers” rather
than “planters,” devoting themselves to the cultivation of a variety of crops
instead of confining their efforts to the exclusive production of a single
staple.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus in a very important particular South Carolina differed from both
Virginia and Georgia—the two members of the State-sisterhood which in
many respects she most closely resembled: for in Georgia the sea-board bore
so small a proportion to the interior that the influence of the coast-dwellers
could not be a very appreciable factor in the general equation. And in
Virginia, a difference of climate produced a corresponding difference in the
mode of life of the country gentry—Virginia planters for the most part
making their homes on their plantations the year round, whereas Carolina
planters were compelled by considerations of health to abandon their plantations
during the summer months. Though some went no farther than to
settlements among the pine woods or along the seashore near at hand, the
great majority either spent their summers in Charleston—the center of
South Carolina refinement and cultivation—or traveled abroad into the
great outside world, thereby rubbing off their rusticity and keeping themselves
in touch with passing events and current interests. Necessarily, the
combined advantages of wealth, education and travel produced in the coast-folk
a polish of manner and a breadth of mind not possessed by the dwellers
of the interior of the State who, year in and year out, vegetated contentedly
on their native soil.</p>

<p class='c011'>The difference between the denizens of the two sections was inevitable.
The trouble was that, instead of regarding their superior advantages as
entailing upon them corresponding duties towards their less favored neighbors,
the people of the sea-board arrogated to themselves the position of
critics, and looked down with scarcely veiled condescension and contempt
upon their rustic brethren of the interior; by whom, it is unnecessary to say,
this attitude was deeply resented.</p>

<p class='c011'>But having meted out the blame that of right belonged to the “low-country”
in this matter, justice demands the statement that—as in all family
disputes—the provocation was by no means entirely on one side. Except
in the matter of politics, the coast had little in common with the interior.
As a class, the people of the “up-country” were ignorant and unpolished.
Their lack of breeding disgusted, their want of cultivation repelled, their
marvelous thrift and instinct for money-getting absolutely bewildered the
low-country intelligence. And when brought together the people of the
coast recoiled with the feeling that they were in contact with an alien race.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Both sections were in fault and both paid the penalty. The development
of the interior was greatly retarded by its obstinate antagonism to all
that savored of the more advanced civilization of the coast; and the coast
suffered in its turn, by frequently finding itself in a weak minority as
regarded measures of sectional advantage. Each faction of the State Legislature
was determined to consult solely its own interests whenever these
appeared to conflict.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such was the condition of affairs up to the period of the Civil War.
At its close, a new era dawned in the life of South Carolina. Previous
conditions were now reversed. The sea-board—formerly the garden spot
of the State—was left depopulated, beggared, ruined; while the interior
had escaped from the terrible ordeal almost unscathed.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was also evident that in recuperative power, there could be no comparison
between the two sections; the conditions which had formerly
operated adversely to the progress of the interior now conducing to its
development.</p>

<p class='c011'>First, and chief of its advantages, were to be reckoned climatic conditions
permitting of white agricultural labor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Secondly, the greatly lessened disparity in numbers between whites and
blacks in its population.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thirdly, a hardier and more homely mode of life, which enabled its
people to adapt themselves with greater readiness to the new order of things.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fourthly, the varied character of its industries; and</p>

<p class='c011'>Lastly, a staple (cotton) naturally suggestive of manufacturing
enterprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>When these combined advantages are taken into account, and the
section possessing them compared with the coast, whose sole source of
revenue lay in the fertile, but miasma-laden rice fields, for the cultivation
of which negro labor was an absolute necessity, it is seen at once how completely
“old things had passed away!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The mere reversal of former conditions, however, was certainly not
calculated in itself to heal the sectional breach. But, fortunately, ameliorating
agencies were at work—the gradual spread of education—increasing
intercourse between the sections, the result of improved facilities of travel,
and also of business enterprises in which both were interested. And far
above and beyond all else in mollifying power, the four years of fellowship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>in suffering for a common cause, which linked the erstwhile jarring sections
together in a closer brotherhood than would probably have been brought
about by generations of peace and prosperity.</p>

<p class='c011'>The frightful race-problems with which South Carolina found herself
confronted at the close of the Civil War, and the grim burlesque of government
which followed, known as the “Reconstruction” period, during which
chaos and crime ran riot in the land, served to weld still more firmly the new
made bond. And when in 1876, after years of almost superhuman patience
under provocation, the people of South Carolina decided that endurance had
ceased to be a virtue, and rose in their righteous indignation; and in the face
of overwhelming odds, by one supreme effort the State righted herself,
“low-country” and “up-country” rejoiced together in true fraternal spirit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Since that time the bond has continued to strengthen. And instead
of being as of old, “a house divided against itself,” the State of South
Carolina is gradually becoming one harmonious and homogeneous whole.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SOCIAL CONDITIONS</h3>

<p class='c013'>In the peculiar internal State-relations which we have been considering,
South Carolina was unique. But in the social and domestic conditions now
to be described, she was a true type and representative of the other
Southern States.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is an accepted truth that in all lands economic conditions determine
social relations. In the South, the stability of the former insured a corresponding
stability in the latter. To borrow a figure from geology, there were
no “faults” in the stratification of Southern society. Each stratum rested
secure and well-defined upon the one beneath it, with none of the perplexing
sudden “dips” and “out croppings,” common in other parts of America.
In that land of belated nineteenth century chivalry and feudalism, the long-exploded
axiom that it took “three generations to make a gentleman” still
held sway as the law governing social usage. As is the case with all laws,
however, there were exceptions to this one. Men of force of character and
intellectual gifts stepped over class barriers at one stride, and took their
place at once in the very fore front of the social ranks.</p>

<p class='c011'>Divisions and subdivisions of society existed, but into these intricate
complexities it is not necessary to enter here. Enough to say that the
“upper-crust” was composed exclusively of the landed proprietors and professional
men. Of trade, this class had a holy horror, although they recognized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>“degrees” in infamy; holding with Cicero that, while the “retail”
trader was to be regarded as “unmitigatedly base,” the “wholesale” trader
might be accounted “mitigatedly” so.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next to this topmost layer came the factors. The factor combined in
his own person the functions of banker, commission merchant, and general
factotum. He sold the planter’s crop, invested his proceeds, negotiated his
loans, and advanced him money when required. Socially, the factor was
the connecting link between the mercantile class and the landed gentry, to
whom, indeed, he was often closely allied by blood. For it was the Southern
custom to pass into a counting-house and thereby convert into “factors,”
such planters’ sons as were considered incapable of receiving a classical or
professional education, and showed no special aptitude for any particular
calling.</p>

<p class='c011'>Below the factor class were innumerable gradations gradually descending
until, at the bottom of the social scale, were to be found the poor whites,
or “crackers,” as they were contempteously termed. Of this element
nothing need be said, as its influence was <i>nil</i>; the Old South being practically
composed of but two classes—its aristocracy and its negroes.</p>

<p class='c011'>In those old days the tone of public morals was pure and high. As a
rule, a Southern gentleman’s word was as good as his bond; for any imputation
on his honor he regarded as a disgrace, and disgrace was the one
thing he dared not face. To these people wealth was not the be-all and
the end-all of existence. Not that they underrated its importance or despised
its advantages, but their whole manner of life was a protest against
making wealth the standard by which to gauge the sum of human achievement,
affixing, as it were, a money value to all things in the heavens above
and in the earth beneath.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, they were—not obstructionists indeed—but strong conservatives;
holding that change is not necessarily synonymous with improvement,
but that it sometimes means retrogression rather than advance. And holding
this creed, they were not carried away by every vagary which presented
itself, whether masquerading in the guise of social panacea or political
hocus-pocus.</p>

<p class='c011'>The conditions of Southern life naturally tended to produce and foster
individuality, and perhaps the most marked trait in Southern character was
an almost fierce independence and a hot resentment of any semblance of control.
The Southerner was quick tempered and somewhat over hasty in
taking offence at fancied slights. But there was nothing vindictive or malevolent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>in his nature, and, his outburst of temper over, if cool reflection
showed him to have been in the wrong, he did not hesitate frankly to
acknowledge himself in fault, and make ample apology for his mistaken
judgment and hot words. As a class, Southerners undoubtedly held a very
good opinion of themselves; and sometimes, where mental ballast was lacking,
this comfortable consciousness of being at quits with the world went to
the head, and effervesced in silly superciliousness and irritating condescension.
But for the most part, the people bore themselves with irreproachable
courtesy and the quiet dignity which springs from self-respect. As a
race they were a brave, fearless people, truthful, honest, and generous to a
fault.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides this common heritage however, the folk of the Carolina coast
possessed certain endowments peculiarly their own—a finished grace of
manner, a keen sense of humor, and a power of quick repartee—their birthright
by virtue of descent from a Huguenot ancestry. This French element
was in truth, a very appreciable quantity in the Carolina equation, exercising
considerable formative influence on character as well as manners. Unlike
the French settlers in other parts of the United States, the Carolina Huguenots,
notwithstanding the inhospitable reception given them on their arrival
in the colony, held their own manfully in their adopted country; and soon
established such friendly relations with their English neighbors, that in the
course of a generation or so, by intermarriage with these, they had ceased
to be a distinctive class of the population, and were only to be traced by
their French names, which they had bestowed upon half the families in the
lower section of the State.</p>

<p class='c011'>One trait remains to be mentioned—a trait common to the entire South.
I allude to the ardent patriotism and intense State-love of the people. This
is proved by the records of the Civil War, which show how gladly substance
and life were both devoted to the service of their beloved country.
Even now, a thrill runs through one, at the recollection of the heroic self-sacrifice
and whole-hearted devotion of the united Southern people to their
“Lost Cause.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>INDIAN AGRICULTURE IN SOUTHERN WISCONSIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>Early writers and travellers were lamentably negligent in recording
many phases of Indian life which it would be desirable to know, especially
those related to the economic activities of these primitive people.
An undue amount of “historical divination” is required in arriving at satisfactory
or even plausible conclusions concerning some of these matters.
The real influence which aboriginal agriculture exercised upon the exploration,
settlement, and development of the Western lands, is well worth our
study. The new comer often received therefrom suggestions as to what
crops would most likely flourish on the various soils and in the different
rain-belts; not to mention the direct effect upon lines of supplies bought or
stolen from the retreating tribes—these are interesting questions, but we
must not expect much specific information concerning them. The methods
of hunting and fighting; of making weapons, utensils, and implements; of
dancing, singing, wooing, are all told by early chroniclers with painstaking
minuteness and detail, but the products of the soil are noticed by them only
in parenthetical phrases or general observations. There is hardly a line yet
found, relating to the agricultural tools used, or the sort of ground chosen
for fields—absolutely nothing as to yield, and next to nothing concerning
the importance of these crops to the Indians themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a long time the Sauk and Foxes had their principal villages near
the Wisconsin River, at the east end of Sauk Prairie, just opposite the
northwest corner of Dane County. These Indians were somewhat above
the average of the tribes of this region in civilization; they lived in more
compact and larger settlements, hence naturally depended more on their
corn-fields than did their more nomadic neighbors to the west. Their corn
was planted along the edge of the woods which fringe the Wisconsin, and
this belt is choice corn-land to-day. Some small parts of it have been kept
in grass from the time of the earlier white settlement, and in those places
old Indian corn-hills may still be seen, the sod holding them in shape. The
Indian cultivated the growing corn by hoeing toward the hill; and as this
became the mellowest spot, the corn was planted each succeeding year in
the same little mound, which grew to be a foot or more in height.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There was a large settlement of Sauk at the lower end of Sauk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Prairie. I have often examined the remains of their tillage there, and
should suppose they raised corn in one lot of at least four hundred acres&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* the four hundred acres is covered with well formed, regular corn-hills.”<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
Just what this writer means by “regular” is not quite clear—probably
that the hills were of uniform size, and approximately the same
distance apart, for it does not appear that the Indians often planted corn in
rows, there being, with their mode of culture, very little occasion for such
methods.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c014'><sup>[5]</sup></a> The Indians of northern Michigan at the present day generally
care for their corn much as did their ancestors of a century ago; and the
few who attempt its cultivation with a horse cultivator do not take the precaution
to plant the corn in rows, but run here and there wherever there
happens to be sufficient room between the hills.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whether or not the Wisconsin Indians, like those of Ohio or New
England, girdled trees so as to rid the land of them, and leave it in a suitable
condition for cultivation by their rude and ineffective tools, is not
stated; but the probability is that little of such work was necessary.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a> The
field at Sauk Prairie just mentioned, lay along the border of the woodland;
and as the prairie was burned off nearly every year, it is reasonable to suppose
that the fire crept into the woods for a greater or less distance, killing
the trees and leaving a considerable belt neither distinctively prairie nor
woods. Naturally this would become overgrown with weeds and saplings,
which could be much more easily eradicated than the heavy growth of trees
or grass. The prairie sod was altogether too tough to be subdued by the
Indians, and nowhere do we find them tilling any considerable area of
genuine prairie soil.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are one or two direct references to Indian fields within Dane
County. While stationed at Fort Crawford, Jefferson Davis visited this
section and left in his journal some remarks pertinent to our subject:
“While on detached service in the summer of 1829, I think I encamped one
night about the site of Madison. The nearest Indian village was on the
opposite side of the lake.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* The Indians subsisted largely on Indian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>corn and wild rice.”<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a> Probably he referred to the place now known as
Winnequah, on the eastern shore of Lake Monona, where a few Indian
corn-hills are still discernable. The nature of the land here at the time of the
Indian occupancy, cannot now be estimated with the same accuracy as in the
case of the Sauk district. It is not on the edge of a prairie; but from the
condition of the present woods about Winnequah, and the sandy nature of
the soil, it is altogether likely that there were sufficient open spots for all the
corn-fields which the small villages of Indians would be likely to cultivate.</p>

<p class='c011'>Capt. Jonathan Carver, who made a trip through the northwest in
1766, in speaking of the Winnebago Indians remarks: “The land
adjacent to the lake [Winnebago] is very fertile, abounding with grapes,
plums, and other fruits, which grow spontaneously. The Winnebagoes
raise on it a great quantity of Indian corn, beans, pumpkins, squashes, and
watermelons, with some tobacco.”<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c014'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Carver also gives an interesting
description of the kind of corn grown by the Indians. We should infer
from what little he says that it is very similar, although not identical, with
the corn raised by the New England Indians in the seventeenth century:
“One spike generally consists of about six hundred grains which are placed
closely together in rows to the number of eight or ten, and sometimes
twelve.”<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c014'><sup>[9]</sup></a> He does not tell us whether or not it is dented; but since he
finds it maturing as far north as Lake Winnebago, and especially as the ears
are long and slender, it is safe to infer that it was the hard flint variety
known as “Yankee corn.” In case the four hundred acres near Sauk
Prairie produced such remarkably large ears—averaging, we should judge,
at least a foot in length, the aggregate yield must have been very great.
Reasoning from this, it is easy to believe the various reports of discoveries
of fifty thousand bushels of corn in <i>cache</i> by armies in the Ohio Valley,
and to the southward. However, the element of uncertainty is by no
means a negligible quantity, and the reader must draw his own conclusions
as to the probable amount of farm produce raised by the Wisconsin Indian.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the most part, the practices and methods of these Indians resembled
those of the tribes farther east. The Sauk and Foxes were scattered up
and down the Wisconsin and Fox rivers; wherever found, they depended
for a living, in part, on the cultivated product of the soil.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c014'><sup>[10]</sup></a> In raising a
crop of corn, or other field products, the Indians had many difficulties with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>which to contend, even more perplexing than those connected with subduing
the native soil. Perhaps the depredations of blackbirds and crows
were the worst; for as soon as other food began to fail them in the fall,
they pounced upon the corn, usually when it was about in the milk or “roasting
ear,” and wrought sad havoc. The Indians were always inordinately
fond of the tender, green corn, and this fact, together with the danger of loss
by birds or frost from leaving it out until maturity, induced them to gather
it early. They were familiar with the fact that corn may be cured while
yet in the green state, and still be desirable food; this fact, as well as the
method of storing, appears in the following quotation:<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c014'><sup>[11]</sup></a> “I observed
several women with bags on their heads and shoulders, appearing heavily
laden, bent down and not raising their faces from the path they were
upon. I never saw individuals contend more with a load that almost
mastered them, than did some of these females. Following them a short
distance to a place where they stopped, I found they were making a <i>cache</i>
of the ripe maize of the season. A sort of cave had been hollowed out in
the side of the hill, about eight feet in diameter at the bottom, and not more
than two or three at the top. To this <i>cache</i> the women were bringing the
corn, a distance of about three miles, and some very young girls were in
the cave storing it away.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* The ears of maize are gathered and
cured whilst the corn is in the milk, and the bags when filled with it are laid
in the cave upon layers of dry grass, one layer above another. When the
cave is full, straw is put in and covered over with dry earth. They cure the
corn in the milk, because the blackbirds are numerous enough to devour it
all if it were left to ripen in the field.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c014'><sup>[12]</sup></a> From this it is seen that the
agricultural methods of Wisconsin Indians were not different from those
farther east and south—the women do the work; the corn is gathered before
fully ripe, and put in <i>caches</i> for safe keeping.</p>

<p class='c011'>It would be hazardous to attempt any estimate of the quantity of corn
raised, even by any one tribe. The Sauk and Foxes appear to have
depended more on products of the soil than did their neighbors. The four
hundred acres raised near where Sauk City now stands, is good evidence
of a total product of no slight proportions, for these Indians had many
other villages scattered along the line of the Fox and Wisconsin rivers.
Speaking of these tribes as a whole, Worden remarks: “The Sacs and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Foxes raise corn, beans and melons, and derive a great part of their subsistence
from agriculture and gardening.”<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c014'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Indian improvidence is usually spoken of as though the red man had
no regard whatever for the morrow; but Pike credits the Osage with the
virtue of rigid economy in saving their corn and beans for seasons when
the chase is likely to fail in supplying the larder.<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c014'><sup>[14]</sup></a> The same author mentions
the drying of pumpkins, for winter use, by the Indians of the plains.
In the same strain Father Allouez, who visited the Western Indians in the
early part of 1670, says of the Outagami: “These savages&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* are
settled in an excellent country,—the soil, which is black there, yielding them
Indian corn in abundance. They live by hunting during the winter returning
to their cabins towards its close, and living there on Indian corn that
they had hidden away the previous Autumn; they season it with fish.”<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c014'><sup>[15]</sup></a>
Again, in speaking of the Oumamis, [Miami], he mentions the fact that on
the first of May they still had corn which they offered him to eat; and of the
Potawatomi, that their land is “very good for Indian corn, of which they
plant fields, and to which they very willingly retire to avoid the famines
that are too common in these quarters.” These famines were usually the
result of drouth which, by drying up the forage plants, drove the big game
away to other sections,<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c014'><sup>[16]</sup></a> leaving the poor Indians dependent on fish and
the grain in stock—the latter being, unhappily, seldom or never found in
quantities sufficient to tide over a famine of any consequence.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c014'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>A traveller in 1669 makes this record on his visit to Green Bay: “I
found here only one village of different nations—Ousaki, Pouteouatami,
Outagami, Orenibigoutz (i. e. Ouinipegouk)—about six hundred souls.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* All these Nations have their fields of Indian corn, squashes, beans,
and tobacco.”<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c014'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In 1793, Robert Dickson wrote of the Indians near Portage: “At
the Falls of the Fox River there is a portage of three-quarters of a mile.
The Indians here raise Indian corn, squash, potatoes, melons, and cucumbers
in great abundance, and good tobacco. On the low lands by the river
great quantities of wild oats [rice] grow.”<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c014'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>As a rule the Indian depended on corn and beans to support him during
his long excursions, whether in peace or war. In the account of the
capture of the Hall girls, which occurred about May, 1832, there is a good
side-light on the Indian commissariat: “When we halted, the Indians
having scalded some beans, and roasted some acorns, desired we should
eat.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* On our arrival several squaws came to our assistance&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*
prepared a place for us to sit down, and presented us some parched corn,
some meal, and maple sugar, mixed, and desired us to eat.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* In the
evening we were presented with a supper consisting of coffee, fried cakes,
boiled corn, and fried venison, with fried leeks.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* When our flour
was exhausted we had coffee, meat, and pounded corn made into soup.”<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c014'><sup>[20]</sup></a>
Later, it is mentioned that the Indians carried pork and potatoes while on
the march. The pork as well as the coffee was, of course, obtained from
the whites, but the potatoes, so-called, were probably wild artichokes which
Lapham found in use as food among the Indians in what is now Brown
County. In 1844 he found them using “a very good kind of potato&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*
the mode of preserving which was entirely new to us. The potatoes, which
are of an oblong shape, and not longer than a man’s thumb are partially
boiled, and carefully peeled while hot, without breaking the pulp, and
strung like so many beads upon a twine or tough thread of bark and then
hung in festoons on the ridge pole of the wigwam, over the smoke of the
fire, where they became thoroughly dry. This process renders the potatoes
fit for transportation and use during the severest frosts without injury.
The squaws take great interest in preparing this article of food which is
about the only vegetable they cultivate.”<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c014'><sup>[21]</sup></a> However, the Indians around
Green Bay were by no means restricted to one agricultural product, although
contact with the white men tended to make them more and more dependent,
since they found it easier to barter furs for food than to raise grain.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the above citations, it appears that the cultivated fields of the
Indians occupied a diagonal line across the state, following the courses of
the Fox and Wisconsin rivers and Green Bay; and that the Sauk, Foxes,
and Winnebago were the most inclined, in the struggle for existence, to
make use of their agricultural knowledge and opportunities. It may also
be shown that there were some important cultivated areas along the Mississippi
and Rock rivers, and some insignificant patches near Lake Michigan.
The settlement of Black Hawk’s followers on the lower part of the Rock,
on the point between that river and the Mississippi is of interest, and these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>were Wisconsin Indians, who had resumed their agricultural labors in a
new home.</p>

<p class='c011'>Something of the skill of these people in choosing land on which to
grow corn, also an idea of the quantity grown, are furnished by Black
Hawk in his <cite>Autobiography</cite>: “In the front a prairie extended to the
Mississippi, and in our rear a continued bluff gently ascended from the
prairie.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* On the side of this bluff we had our corn-fields, extending
about two miles up parallel with the larger river, where they adjoined those
of the Foxes, whose village was on the same stream opposite the lower end
of Rock Island and three miles distant from ours. We had eight hundred
acres in cultivation, including what we had on the islands in Rock River.
The land around our village which remained unbroken, was covered with
blue-grass which furnished excellent pasture for our horses.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* The
land being very fertile never failed to produce good crops of corn, beans,
pumpkins, and squashes.”<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c014'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Black Hawk then goes on to state that, owing to encroachments of the
white settlers, his people had hard work to find sufficient land on which
to plant corn, and gives a sorrowful account of the distress caused by the
confiscation of their crops by the whites. Black Hawk does not give any
estimate of the area cultivated by the Foxes, but Col. John Shaw, in speaking
of both settlements, estimates the fields at five thousand acres.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c014'><sup>[23]</sup></a> This
is probably an exaggeration, but it serves its purpose in giving some notion
of the importance of agricultural industry to the Indians themselves, and
surely it was not inconsiderable. Anyone wishing to estimate the amount
of these products by the various tribes, will find some data in the <cite>Emigrant’s
and Traveller’s Guide</cite>, where a fairly good estimate of the numbers of the
several Indian tribes in 1834 appears.<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c014'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>A great many more references could be given, emphasizing the reliance
of the red man on his rude husbandry; but perhaps enough has already
been said to make it plain that something is due him for taking the initial
step in the development of the great grain regions of the upper Mississippi
valley. Neither are we left wholly to deduce our conclusions from circumstantial
evidence. The early military expeditions of the West and
Northwest were for the most part dependent on supplies obtained from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Indians.<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c014'><sup>[25]</sup></a> The accounts of the Lewis and Clark expedition tell of the
dependence of the party on provisions furnished by the Indians, and even so
far north as the Mandan village they traded for Indian corn. At
Mackinac Island, a point hardly within the present corn belt, the Indians
raised a sufficient quantity of that cereal to attract the attention of the
British garrison as well as of various travellers. As early as 1766 Jonathan
Carver saw the importance of the agricultural products of the
Wisconsin Indians, and after enumerating the crops grown by the
“Saukies” before mentioned, speaks thus of the Sauk village: “This
place is esteemed the best market for traders to furnish themselves with
provisions, of any within eight hundred miles of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus it is seen that the Indians, on their own account, furnished provisions
for their own war parties; for the English forays against Americans
and Spanish; for explorers like Marquette, Carver, and Lewis and Clark,
and the long list of later adventurers who came to spy out the land and
eventually to expel the tribesmen from their fields. The traders who
ranged the woods and rivers for a century before civilization ruined their
traffic, depended in a large measure on the meagre stores of Indian corn
and beans; while even the troops which finally hunted the natives from their
homes, filled their camp kettles either from the <i>caches</i> or the corn fields of
the fugitives. Nor was this all. The earliest settlers seized upon the little
cultivated plots as the most desirable ground for their own first plantings,
and utilized the native-grown seed, since it was known to be adapted to the
soil and climate. It is interesting to note that the two crops which the
Indians prized most highly, corn and tobacco, are at present two of the
foremost products of Wisconsin.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE AUTHENTICITY OF CARVER’S “TRAVELS”</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>In his paper on “The Travels of Jonathan Carver,” read before the
American Historical Association in Chicago, December 29, 1904, Prof.
E. G. Bourne of Yale University, presented the results of an investigation
as to the originality and authenticity of the second part of this famous
book, which is devoted to giving a systematic account of the manners and
customs of the Indians in the Northwest, and of the animals and products
of the soil.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Professor brought to light the fact that as early as 1792 Oliver
Wolcott, then Comptroller of the Treasury in Philadelphia, wrote the geographer
Jedidiah Morse, that he had been informed on good authority that
the book was written under very inauspicious circumstances; adding that
Carver was an ignorant man, incapable of writing such a work, and that
there was reason to believe it to be a compilation from other authors.<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c014'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Next, he cited contemporaneous but entirely independent criticisms
by Schoolcraft in 1823,<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c014'><sup>[27]</sup></a> and by Keating in 1824,<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c014'><sup>[28]</sup></a> both of whom assert that
the author of the <cite>Travels</cite> drew considerably from Lahontan. In addition,
Schoolcraft declared that material was also derived from Charlevoix’s
<cite>Travels</cite>. More detailed and more positive still, were the assertions of
Greenhow, the historian of Oregon, that the second part of Carver’s <cite>Travels</cite>
was a compilation from Charlevoix, Hennepin, and Lahontan.<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c014'><sup>[29]</sup></a> Greenhow
was familiar with Keating’s views, but apparently not with Schoolcraft’s,
whose <cite>Memoirs</cite> were published in 1851, or with Wolcott’s, whose letter first
saw light in 1846. These early criticisms appear to have escaped the
notice of later writers who have written upon Carver’s <cite>Travels</cite>, for neither
Moses Coit Tyler, in his <cite>History of American Literature</cite>, nor the authors
of the articles on Carver in the various cyclopædias, breathe any suspicion
as to the authenticity of the work.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the second part of his paper, Professor Bourne gave the results of
his attempt to test the correctness of the assertions of Wolcott, Schoolcraft,
Keating, and Greenhow. He cited a few passages showing how the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>author of the <cite>Travels</cite>, whoever he might be, drew from books information
which a genuine traveller would not think of going to books for. For
example, the description of the personal appearance of the Indians was
taken from Lahontan; of their keenness in detecting a trail, from Charlevoix;
of their game of lacrosse partly from Charlevoix and partly from
Adair’s <cite>History of the American Indians</cite>. The description of the Indian
sled (or toboggan), with which the real Carver must have been perfectly
familiar, is taken word for word from Charlevoix. Again, the real Carver
must have many times seen Indians scalp prisoners, for he was a veteran
of the French and Indian War, and one of the survivors of the Fort
William Henry massacre; but notwithstanding such presumable personal
observation, the author of Carver’s <cite>Travels</cite> borrows word for word Adair’s
account of the process of scalping. The accounts of the animals are largely
from Charlevoix. “The short vocabulary of the Chippeway Language”
is almost entirely taken from Lahontan’s “Dictionary of the Algonkin
Language.” Some of the changes are pure blunders of hasty transcription,
which one familiar with the language, as Carver pretended to be, could not
have made; as, for example, where Carver gives <cite>Sheshikwee</cite> for “dart,”
when Lahontan gives it as the name of a particular kind of dance; or again,
where Carver gives the word for “heart” which Lahontan gave for “hart.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Professor Bourne’s conclusion was, that the second and larger part of
Carver’s <cite>Travels</cite> is not an original work, but a literary compilation, like
Sir John Mandeville’s <cite>Travels</cite> or Benzoni’s <cite>History of the New World</cite>;
and that the first part was probably put together by the same writer, from
Carver’s notes or oral recollections. As to the extent or reality of Carver’s
journey up the St. Peter’s (or Minnesota) River, Professor Bourne felt
disposed to accept the view of Keating, who apparently had studied the
question very thoroughly on the ground, that Carver had entered the river
but did not ascend it as far as he pretended.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>OLD FORT GEORGE, ON THE BATTERY, NEW YORK CITY</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>On July 30, 1904, the contractors who were excavating for the Rapid
Transit tunnel in Battery Park, New York City, dug up at a point
twenty feet west of the center line of State street and eighty-seven
feet north of the center line of Bridge street, a small monumental stone of
great historical significance. This stone, which was two feet nine inches
below the surface of the ground, marked the site of the southwest bastion
of Old Fort George.</p>

<p class='c011'>The great historical value of this monument was immediately appreciated
by the American Scenic and Historical Preservation Society and the
New York Historical Society, for it supplied the <i>datum</i> for the exact location
of the boundaries of the old fort, which, under various names, had
occupied the site of the birthplace of the Metropolis.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Secretary of the American Scenic and Historical Preservation
Society on August 1, wrote to Mayor McClellan, and President Orr of the
Rapid Transit Commission, requesting that the bearings of the exact site
of the monument be carefully taken, and that the stone be replaced above
ground on the same spot as soon as Battery Park was restored to its normal
condition. On August 12th, the Scenic Society’s letter was formally
approved by the Rapid Transit Board, and the acting chief engineer was
authorized to construct a proper pedestal for the monument and restore it
as soon as practicable.</p>

<p class='c011'>The New York Historical Society, through whose instrumentality the
stone was originally erected in 1818, also manifested the liveliest interest in
the matter, and when the stone is replaced will probably hold formal
ceremonies.</p>

<p class='c011'>The circumstances of the original erection of the monument are
extremely interesting:</p>

<p class='c011'>Under date of June 10, 1817, Mr. John Pintard, Secretary of the New
York Chamber of Commerce, wrote to the New York Historical Society as

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>The Chamber of Commerce appropriated 20 pounds to pay Mr. Rittenhouse
for his services in the above matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1790,<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c014'><sup>[30]</sup></a> Fort George was razed to the ground, part of the material
was used for filling in and enlarging Battery Park, the Government Building
was erected on part of the old fort site, and all trace of the southwest
bastion where the observations of Montresor and Rittenhouse were made
was lost.</p>

<p class='c011'>The New York Historical Society, on June 10, 1817, therefore voted
to apply to the Corporation of the City to ascertain the site of the bastion
an which Messrs. Rittenhouse and Montresor made their observations in
1769 and to erect a monument with suitable inscriptions to mark the same.
Messrs. John Pintard, Dr. John Griscom and Dr. Samuel L. Mitchill were
appointed a committee to prepare the memorial to the Common Council and
present it to that body. The memorial, dated June 16, 1817, recited the
facts here given and said: “It is conceived by the Historical Society that
it is worthy the care of a cultivated and enlightened people to ascertain and
perpetuate by a monumental stone the aforesaid site.” It also called attention
to the fact that “Your magnificent City Hall has been erected considerably
to the northward of the place where Fort George formerly stood,” and
requested that its latitude also be accurately determined and marked by a
monument with appropriate inscriptions.</p>

<p class='c011'>On July 8, 1817, the New York Historical Society Committee reported
to the Society that the Committee of Arts and Sciences of the Common
Council, to whom their Memorial had been referred, had reported favorably
thereupon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The report of the Common Council Committee, after reciting the facts
of the survey in 1769, proceeds as follows:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The communication from the Historical Society having stated this
fact as taken from the minutes of the Chamber of Commerce, request that
the Corporation would endeavor to find the site of the Flag Bastion of Fort
George and erect on the spot a stone with an inscription stating the latitude,
when and by whom taken, and that a suitable person or persons be employed
to take the latitude of the City Hall and erect a stone in front or near it
with the latitude marked thereon which shall serve as a monument or
milliarium from which all distances shall be reckoned and which will be considered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>the proper latitude of the place, being taken from the largest and
most elegant and permanent building in the City.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your Committee think that the subject of this communication is of
great importance and that so large and growing a city as New York, should
not longer remain without its latitude being accurately ascertained and that
a place of observation should be known and designated; wherefore they
recommend,</p>

<p class='c011'>“1, That the Street Commissioner be directed to ascertain as nearly as
possible the site of the Southwest Bastion of Fort George and to erect
thereon a monumental stone on which shall be marked the latitude as taken
in 1769 and by whom;</p>

<p class='c011'>“2, That a suitable person or persons be employed under the direction
of your committee to find the Latitude of the City Hall and to erect a
monumental stone near it with suitable inscriptions from which mileage or
distances from the city shall hereafter be computed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One other subject connected with the one before your committee,
though not in the petition under consideration, they beg to submit to the
Board. The City Surveyors frequently differ in their computations of distances
and direction in consequence sometimes of the different variations
of the magnetic needles used by them. If a place was fixed in some elevated
situation, (as the cupola of the City Hall, for instance) from which some
permanent object on Long Island or the Jersey Shore could be observed, and
the true direction ascertained, it might serve the purpose of regulating surveys
and in some measure of correcting errors, as thereby the compasses of
all surveyors might at any time be adjusted. Wherefore your committee
recommend the adoption of the following resolution:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Resolved, That the Street Commissioner be directed to ascertain if
any proper object can be seen from the Cupola of the City Hall which may
be fixed upon as a mark to ascertain the direction of the compass from the
said cupola; and that a stone slab be fixed somewhere on the top of the
Hall with marks thereon by which the true direction of the magnetic needle
of surveyors’ compasses may at all times be regulated and adjusted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Respectfully submitted.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>A WAR LETTER OF WALT WHITMAN</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>(<i>His opinion of President Lincoln</i>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>[The original letter dated Washington, March 19, 1863, is owned in New York and
is of exceptional interest, as written to two intimate friends and revealing Whitman at
his very best. He says it is the longest he has ever written, and that he is “writing
at night, while taking care of the child of a friend who had gone to see Matilda Heron
in <cite>Medea</cite>.”]</p>

<p class='c022'>*&#160;*&#160;* After describing his life in Washington, among the soldiers,
he refers thus to President Lincoln:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Congress does not seize hard upon me&#160;... much gab, great fear of
public opinion; plenty of low business talent, but no masterful man in Congress
(probably best so)—<span class='sc'>I think well of the President</span>. He has a
face like a Hoosier Michael Angelo, so awful ugly it becomes beautiful, with
its strange mouth, its deep cut criss-cross lines, and its doughnut complexion.
My notion is, too, that underneath his outside smutched manner, and stories
from third-class country bar rooms (it is his humor), Mr. Lincoln keeps a
fountain of first class practical telling wisdom. I do not dwell on the supposed
failures of his government; he has shown I sometimes think an almost
supernatural tact in keeping the ship afloat at all, with head steady, not
only not going down and now certain not to, but with proud and resolute
spirit, and flag flying in sight of the world, menacing and high as ever.
I say never yet Captain, never ruler, had such a perplexing dangerous task
as his the past two years. I more and more rely upon his idiomatic western
genius, careless of court dress or of court decorums....”</p>
<p class='c022'>(<i>His hospital experiences are very interesting.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'>“... These Hospitals, so different from all others—these thousands,
and ten and twenties of thousands of American young men, badly wounded&#160;... operated on, pallid with diarrhoea, languishing, dying with fever,
pneumonia, etc., open a new world somehow to me, giving closer insights&#160;... showing our humanity&#160;... tried by terrible fearful tests, probed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>deepest, the living souls, the body’s tragedies, bursting the petty bonds of
art. To these, what are your dreams and poems, even the oldest and the
tearfullest? Not old Greek mighty ones, where man contends with fate
(and always yields)—not Virgil showing Dante on and on among the
agonized and damned, approach what here I see and take a part in. For
here I see, not at intervals but quite always, how certain man, our American
man—how he holds himself cool and unquestioned master above all pains
and bloody mutilations.... This, then, what frightened us all so long!
Why it is put to flight with ignominy—a mere stuffed scarecrow of the
fields. O death where is thy sting? O grave where is thy victory?...”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LETTER OF LINCOLN, DECLINING AN OFFER OF OFFICE</h3>

<p class='c013'>⁂ It is easy to see the great personal interest of such a letter as this.
It marks a period in Lincoln’s life, the importance of which can hardly be
over-estimated. In Morse’s <cite>Life of Lincoln</cite>, it is said that upon the offer
of the position, “controlled by the sensible advice of his wife, he fortunately
declined.”</p>

<h3 class='c018'>THE NEW YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY</h3>

<p class='c013'>The 100th anniversary of the founding
of the Society was celebrated on
Tuesday evening, Nov. 22, 1904, by a
banquet. The president announced that
Mr. Henry Dexter, a fellow member
had presented to the Society the sum
of $150,000, and in addition the
granite for the entire front of the
central portion of the new building,
Central Park West, 76th–77th Sts. A
medal in bronze and silver has been
struck to commemorate the founding
of the institution.</p>

<p class='c011'>At an annual meeting (Jan. 3d,
1905), of the Society, the following
officers were elected for the ensuing
year: President, Samuel V. Hoffman;
first vice-president, Frederic
W. Jackson; second vice-president,
Francis R. Schell; foreign corresponding
secretary, Archer M. Huntington;
domestic corresponding secretary,
George R. Schieffelin; recording
secretary, Acosta Nichols;
treasurer, Charles A. Sherman; librarian,
Robert H. Kelby.</p>

<p class='c011'>At a stated meeting held February
7th, Mr. A. Emerson Palmer, Secretary
of Board of Education, read a
very interesting and instructive address
on “A Century of Public
Schools in the City of New York,”
with stereopticon illustrations.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Society resolved to take measures
to celebrate in 1909 the ter-centenary
of the discovery of this part
of North America by Henry Hudson,
the 200th anniversary of that event
having been celebrated by the Society
on September 4th, 1809.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>RHODE ISLAND HISTORICAL SOCIETY</h3>

<p class='c013'>At the annual meeting Jan. 10, Ex-Chief
Justice Stiness paid a glowing
tribute to the character and ability of
the late Judge Horatio Rogers,
formerly President of the Society.
Prof. Albert Harkness of Brown
University, the present president delivered
a valuable address on “Some
Phases in the Development of History.”
The librarian, Mr. Brigham,
in the course of his report on the accessions
to the library during 1904,
made this remark, which may be commended
to the attention of those who
have accumulations of such material
which seem to them only fit to be
burnt, as occupying space, and not
even worth offering for the acceptance
of any library of reference:
“In many cases these gifts have been
made with the apology that they were
too trivial, and hardly worth the acceptance.
But it is the ephemeral
pamphlet and the unimportant report
that is likely to be asked for by the
next generation, just as we to-day are
searching, too often in vain, for the
transitory publication of a half century
ago.”</p>

<h3 class='c018'>THE DEATH OF WALTER N. BUTLER</h3>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Mary (Mower) Baldwin, who
died in Oneida County, N. Y., Dec.
10, 1904, was a daughter of Peter
Mower, a Revolutionary soldier.
His brother George, was one of the
party of patriots who with several
Indians, pursued the notorious Tory
and killed him at the ford of West
Canada Creek, Oct. 30, 1781.</p>

<p class='c011'>History has always credited the
fatal shot to an unnamed Oneida Indian,
but Mrs. Baldwin in whose family
it was a tradition, always declared
that it was fired by her uncle George,
the only white man who had kept up
so far with the Indians. Butler after
crossing the ford in safety, dismounted
from his horse; Mower, recognizing
him by his uniform—the
notorious “Butler’s Rangers”—fired
and killed him.—<cite>American Monthly

<p class='c021'>Richard Dexter came from Ireland, and
belonged to a family which from the beginning
of the twelfth century has been
prominent in Irish history. The genealogy,
therefore, is prefaced by a chapter on
“Early Irish Records Relating to the Dexter
Family.” Mr. Mills has well performed
the labor of arranging the materials which
came into his hands, the authorities for
the statements in them being indicated in
a table of references <a id='t119'></a>made by Orrando
Perry Dexter. The good index, the convenient
size of the book, its letterpress
and binding, are all mentionable points.
The illustrations are two in number, one
being a coat of arms in color.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; ***</p>

<p class='c021'>The Plymouth branch, the Connecticut

Churchill family constitute the three divisions
of this work, followed by an appendix
of names unconnected with the above lines,
and preceded by Mr. Bodge’s preface which
concludes with “The Churchill Family in
England.” Mr. Bodge explains that,
owing to the death of the compilers, the
task of preparing their collections for the
press was left to him, a labor which, as
would be expected, he has ably performed.
The plan on which the genealogy is
arranged is that of the New England
Historic Genealogical Society, in its organ,
the “Register,” by means of which the
immense mass of notes and correspondence
entrusted to Mr. Bodge have assumed the
lucid order which alone renders a genealogy
serviceable. There is a most carefully
prepared index of nearly ninety pages.

Square 4to. pp. 251. Ill.</p>

<p class='c021'>The sketches are introduced by a memoir
of Judge Woodbury, the compiler. The
genealogical value of the work is apparent
from the fact that, beside the Woodbury
pedigree, it includes those of such families
as the Quincys, the Palgraves, the Wendells,
the Clapps, the De Kays, the Willetts,
the Perkinses, and others. Though left
unfinished and inaccessible at Judge Woodbury’s
death, the sketches are nevertheless
presented here in a nearly completed form,
though it has been found impossible to fill
omissions occasioned by the loss of some of
the original papers. The mental energy,
the skill and the humor characteristic of
the compiler will be recognized in these
pages, which, though not intended for the
public, will be attractive to many outside
of the readers for whom they were
designed. Paper, print and binding are
good. There is no index.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; ***</p>

<h3 class='c012'>REPLIES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>3. <i>a.</i> <span class='sc'>Maverick</span>—There is no
absolute proof that Moses Maverick
was son of Rev. John and brother of
Samuel, but the editor of this department
(a descendant of Moses) is satisfied
that Rev. John Maverick was
father of Moses, Samuel, Antipas
and Silas, notwithstanding what Palfrey
and Savage wrote to the contrary.</p>

<p class='c021'>A thorough examination of the
whole matter has brought to light no
evidence which contradicts the statement
of John Josselyn, who was a
guest of Samuel Maverick several
days in July, 1638, that Mr. Maverick,
the minister, was father of
Samuel, the commissioner (Josselyn’s
Two Voyages, 1865 edition, pages 13,
20 and 190); nor of the statement of
Col. Cartwright in 1665 that Mr.
Samuel Maverick had mother, wife,
children and brothers living in
Massachusetts at that date. (N. E.
H. and G. Register, vol. 48, p. 207).</p>

<p class='c017'>There is no record of the death of
the widow of Rev. John Maverick,
and I have no doubt that she was the
mother of Samuel Maverick and lived
with him during her widowhood. A
point worth noticing in this connection
is that Samuel Maverick in
writing to a man who lived near
where Rev. John Maverick had lived
after his marriage in England, says
that his mother “presents her humble
service.”</p>

<p class='c022'>The direct evidence of Josselyn
and Cartwright both of whom had
ample opportunity by association with
Samuel Maverick to learn about the
family, is not disqualified by the unsupported
opinion of these two eminent
historical scholars.—<span class='sc'>Editor.</span></p>

<p class='c030'>A HISTORY SYLLABUS FOR
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. Published
by D. C. Heath &#38; Co., Boston,
Mass., 1904. $1.20 net.</p>

<p class='c011'>This Syllabus consists of four outlines
in History. (1) Ancient History (the
major portion Greek and Roman), (2)
Mediæval and Modern European History,
(3) English History, and (4) American
History and Government. General suggestion
to teachers in regard to the method
and use of the outlines and useful bibliographies
furnish helpful and necessary data
for the school work of preparation and
recitation.</p>

<p class='c011'>The primary object of the syllabus is to
provide definite and practical material in
training pupils to meet the college entrance
requirements. Those schools, also, which
do not prepare their pupils to pass college
examinations will find the book useful.</p>

<p class='c011'>The syllabus is wisely not intended for
boys and girls of thirteen years of age.
Pure narration is best for them at this
age, as the living voice serves to arouse
interest and to furnish a stimulus for the
sterner work of wide and varied reading.</p>

<p class='c011'>Grave, but not unsurmountable difficulties,
will arise in the actual working out
of this syllabus from the inadequate preparation
of the teacher and from the failure
to provide the student always with the
books for reading.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet these difficulties ought to be overcome,
since the slavish method of simply
hearing the recitation from the text-book
must give way to the more comprehensive
method of reading many writers.</p>

<p class='c011'>As these outlines have been prepared by
able university professors and successful
secondary school teachers, they are the
product of careful planning and actual experience.</p>

<p class='c011'>Among the historical books of 1901, I know none more interesting or
valuable than Mr. <span class='sc'>Codman’s</span>, and it is greatly to be regretted that he did
not live to witness its deserved success.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Winston Churchill</span> (author of <cite>The Crisis</cite>) says: “This book
richly deserves the prominent notice given it (by a leading literary journal).
It revives a most important and glorious episode in the history of this country,
and every American will be the better for reading of the heroic struggles of
Arnold’s men across the wilderness. It is a book which seems essential to every
library.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the author failed to fully recognize his opportunity for illustrating the
story, giving portraits of only four of the twenty or more officers of the
expedition.</p>

<p class='c011'>In my edition I insert <i>thirteen additional portraits, several of which have
never appeared before, and nine other illustrations</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The biographical notices of the original have been extended wherever
possible. These various improvements add much value to the original work,
not only to the bibliophile but to the general reader.</p>

<p class='c011'>The expedition to Quebec, through the trackless wilderness of Maine, is
easily the most dramatic episode of the Revolution. It was led by one who
was destined to a brilliant career as a soldier, and a disgraceful end as a traitor
to his country. But for two events it would have been completely successful,
and the whole history of our Revolution changed thereby—the territory of the
original thirteen Colonies being augmented by the vast domain now comprehended
under the general name of British America, and our country thus
extending from the shores of the Arctic Ocean to the Rio Grande.</p>

<p class='c011'>These two incidents were, first: the month-late start of the expedition,
because of which the terrible flood in the Dead River, with the resultant hardships,
was encountered by those whom one of their number, many years later,
justly termed “that band of Heroes”—and, second: the wound which disabled
Arnold himself when, during the desperate attack on Quebec, his inspiring
presence and wonderful leadership were most needed by his men.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Codman’s book is the only modern account of this important “prologue
of the Revolution,” as it has been styled by another author. No full
understanding of the importance of Arnold’s enterprise and the heroism of his
men is possible without having read it. Its terse diction and graphic style
make it most interesting reading, and the numerous illustrations (most of them
made expressly for it) add greatly to its value.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sample pages will be sent free on request. Address the <span class='sc'>Magazine</span> of
<span class='sc'>History</span>, 281 Fourth Ave., N. Y.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR 1905</h3>

<p class='c013'>I expect to publish within the coming twelve months several interesting
items of Americana, viz:</p>

<p class='c032'>I.—<span class='sc'>The History of the Second Company, Governor’s Foot-Guard</span> of the
State of Connecticut; by Jason Thomson, Esq., of the New Haven Bar (a
member of the Company). This was originally issued as a pamphlet, but
has long been out of print. The Company is the third oldest military
organization in the United States, beginning its history with service in the
Revolution when Benedict Arnold, its first captain, took the Colony powder
by force from the hesitant Selectmen of New Haven, and marched to
Cambridge, accompanied by Israel Putnam, to join the patriot forces
there. It has since served in the War of 1812, the War of the Rebellion,
and the Spanish-Cuban War. The history of such an organization is
obviously well worth preserving and enlarging by illustrations, as I have
done. It will contain:</p>

<p class='c034'>1.  A rare plate of Benedict Arnold, in uniform, as he appeared before
<i>Quebec</i>.</p>

<p class='c034'>2.  A colored plate, showing the present uniform of the Company.</p>

<p class='c034'>3.  A most interesting reproduction of a document of unique interest—the
original manuscript petition to the Assembly of Connecticut, praying
for the incorporation of the Company. This is signed by all the original
members of the Company, including Arnold and his brother-in-law, Pierpont
Edwards, who afterwards, by the irony of Fate, became the executor
of his estate, at the discovery of his treason.</p>

<p class='c034'>The original is owned by the New Haven Colony Historical Society,
and will be reproduced, not by engraving, but by an actual photograph—folding
to fit the size of the page. The edition will be limited to 250 copies,
of which 248 will be for sale.</p>

<p class='c034'>200 will be octavo (6 × 9) gilt top, bound in cloth. $3.00.</p>

<p class='c034'>50 will be large paper, bound in boards, 8 × 11, untrimmed edges, gilt
top, special paper. $5.00.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c035'>
    <div><i>Postage extra on each.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c034'>The printing will be from type, distributed as soon as the work has been
done, and this edition will never be duplicated.</p>

<p class='c032'>II.—<span class='sc'>The Poems of Edward Coate Pinkney.</span> With a biographical sketch of
of the poet, by Eugene L. Didier, author of a “Life of Edgar A. Poe,”
“Life of Madame Bonaparte,” etc. The original edition of these poems
is now one of the rarest items of Americana. It was published in 1825,
and won the admiration of the chief American critics, Poe among them,
who pronounced Pinkney to be “the first of American lyrists,” and his
poem, “<cite>A Health</cite>,” (of which I give two verses herewith) “especially
beautiful—full of spirit and brilliancy.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>A HEALTH</div>
  </div>

<div class='lg-container-b c036'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I fill this cup to one made up of loveliness alone,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A woman, of her gentle sex the seeming paragon;</div>
      <div class='line'>To whom the better elements and kindly stars have given</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A form so fair that, like the air, ’tis less of earth than heaven.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Her every tone is music’s own, like those of morning birds,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And something more than melody dwells ever in her words;</div>
      <div class='line'>The coinage of her heart are they, and from her lips each flows</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As one may see the burthened bee forth issue from the rose.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Only Pinkney’s untimely death—before he was twenty-five—prevented
his becoming one of the foremost poets of our country. The <cite>North American
Review</cite>, then the highest literary authority in the country, said: “If
the name of Thomas Carew or Sir John Harrington had been attached to
these poems, we should, in all probability, like others, have been completely
taken in.” Another critic declared: “Some of his poems are not
surpassed by any similar productions in the English language.” I risk
nothing in saying that Pinkney’s readers of 1905 will re-echo these
praises—and I trust all who have heretofore sustained me in my historical
publications will give as hearty support to this, my first effort in the field
of American poetry. The edition will consist of 250 copies, of which 200
will be in octavo (6 × 9) form, gilt top, uncut edges, at $3.00.</p>

<p class='c011'>50 copies, on special paper, large paper (8 × 11). $5.00.</p>

<p class='c032'>III.—<span class='sc'>Adventures in the Wilds of America and the British-American
Provinces.</span> By Charles Lanman, author of <cite>A Dictionary of Congress</cite>, <cite>The
Private Life of Daniel Webster</cite>, etc., etc. With an Appendix by Lieut.
Campbell Hardy, Royal Artillery.</p>

<p class='c034'>2 vols., octavo. 500 pp. each. Illustrated. Portrait, and memoir of
the author by William Abbatt. Price $10.00.</p>

<p class='c034'>Large paper (8 × 11) 3 vols. (consecutive paging), special fine paper.
Only 15 copies. $20.00.</p>

<p class='c034'>Originally published in 1857, this most valuable and interesting work
has long been out of print and scarce, and hence not known to the present
day as its merits deserve.</p>

<p class='c034'>While other books on similar subjects have been issued since, I think
none of them—or all combined—equal this, as a record not alone of
sport, but of travel, description of scenery, literature and legend (for the
author has recorded many most beautiful Indian legends). The range of
his journeys was from Florida to Labrador, and from the Atlantic to the
present St. Paul and Minneapolis. His style needs no encomium from me.
I prefer to quote from letters to him from <span class='sc'>Washington Irving</span> and
<span class='sc'>Edward Everett</span>:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c035'>

</div>

<p class='c034'>I am glad to learn that you intend to publish your narrative and descriptive writings,
in a collected form. I have read parts of them as they were published separately, and
the great pleasure derived from the perusal makes me desirous of having the whole in
my possession. They carry us into the fastnesses of our mountains, the depth of our
forests, the watery wilderness of our lakes and rivers, giving us pictures of savage life
and savage tribes, Indian legends, fishing and hunting anecdotes, the adventures of
trappers and backwoodsmen; our whole arcanum, in short, of indigenous poetry and
romance: to use a favorite phrase of the old discoverers, “they lay open the secrets of
the country to us.”</p>

<p class='c034'>I return you thanks for the delightful entertainment which your Summer rambles
have afforded me. I do not see that I have any literary advice to give you, excepting
to keep on as you have begun. You seem to have the happy, enjoyable humor of old
Izaak Walton, and I trust you will give us still further scenes and adventures on our
great internal waters, depicted with the freshness and skill of your present volumes.</p>

<p class='c034'>With the best wishes for your further success, I am</p>

<p class='c017'>I fully concur with the opinions expressed by Mr. Irving on the subject of a collective
edition of your narrative and descriptive writings. While I am not familiar with
all of them, from those which I have read and from his emphatic and discriminating
commendation, I am confident the series would be welcomed by a large class of readers.
You have explored nooks in our scenery seldom visited, and described forms of life
and manners of which the greater portion of our busy population are entirely ignorant.</p>

<p class='c021'>A selection of a few of Mr. Lanman’s chapters will give a slight idea of
the variety of his book:</p>

<p class='c017'>Legends of the Illinois—Lake Winnipeg—Fish of the Upper Mississippi—Down
the St. Lawrence—The Saguenay River—The Hermit of
Aroostook—The Falls of Tallulah—The Valley of Virginia—The Cheat
River Country—Tombigbee and Black Warrior Rivers—Accomac—A
Week in a Fishing Smack—A Virgina Barbecue—Esquimaux of Labrador—The
Western Pioneer.</p>

<p class='c030'>IV.—<span class='sc'>Garden’s Anecdotes of the Revolution</span> (both series). The author,
Alexander Garden, was Major in Lee’s Legion—and his work is one of
the best on its theme. The first volume was published at Charleston, in
1822; the second in 1824. Each is scarce and valuable, the second particularly
so. I propose revising the text, to eliminate errors, and to issue
my edition in two octavo volumes (6 × 9) with a number of illustrations,
including one or more of the author, and one each of the brothers Pinckney
(not heretofore published), and a number of landscapes.</p>

<p class='c034'>The edition will be limited to 200 copies (6 × 9) and 50, large paper
(8 × 11)—the former in cloth, gilt top, with paper label; the latter in
charcoal boards, gilt top, and untrimmed edges. The prices will be $10.00
and $15.00 respectively.</p>

<p class='c032'>N. B.—All these works will be printed in large type (Small Pica, same as this
line) on fine paper, well bound and produced in the general style of my
other publications. Address, William Abbatt, 281 Fourth Ave., N. Y.</p>
